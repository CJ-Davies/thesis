\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Content -} Short (10 pages is probably far too much). High level introduction to the concepts/topics involved in the thesis, very short/broad definitions of any terms introduced in the title (eg `simultaneous presence'), overview of the rest of the document, list of contributions/donations of this document
	\item \textbf{What has been done -} Nothing.
	\item \textbf{What is left to do/how long should it take -} Should be one of the last things to be written, maybe a few days of writing.
\end{itemize}
