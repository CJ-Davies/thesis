\label{introduction}

%=========================================================================================================

A tourist steps into a 15th century chapel. Although the chapel is in remarkable condition for a building that is over 500 years old (it is even still in active use!) it looks markedly different today than it did when it was first built back in 1450. The tourist dons a head-mounted display, which via a pair of front mounted cameras allows her to still see where she is going as she starts to explore the chapel. Once in the centre of the building, she stops walking and presses a button on a controller that she holds in her hand. Her view of the chapel around her disappears and is replaced with an immersive virtual reconstruction of the chapel as it stood over 500 years ago. The view changes appropriately as she turns her head, allowing her to look all around at how the chapel used to be. She releases the button and is returned to the present day, where she continues walking through the chapel until she reaches the altar. She presses the button again and once more her view switches to that of the virtual chapel, which has moved to match her new position at the altar, allowing her to inspect its 1450 counterpart.

This is not an augmented reality system which superimposes virtual objects upon the real world. This is a \textit{parallel reality} system that allows her to switch between seeing the real world and the equivalent vantage in a complete, immersive virtual environment, allowing access to a level of tandem virtuality unprecedented of augmentations.

\section{Parallel Reality}
\label{intro-parallel-reality}
The central theme of this thesis is the concept of `parallel reality', a new category of alternate reality defined thus:

\vspace{7mm}

\textbf{Parallel Reality:} A system comprising two environments, one real and the other virtual, each complete unto itself and wherein the user may freely switch between them.

%=====================

The concept of alternate realities has become a mainstay both of science fiction and of serious academic research, with the concept of other worlds and how we can either visit them or bring them into our real world keeping authors and scientists alike fascinated for decades. The concept of these `virtual worlds' dates back far into human history, long before mankind's invention of the transistor and the computers that would subsequently harness it.

\begin{quote}
	\textit{``Virtual worlds, or as we will now more broadly define them, immersive experiences delivered through the human imagination, have their origins in deep prehistory. Whether these varieties of nonphysical, dreamlike realities were communicated by our ancestors through the imitation of animals, the incarnation of spirits, the painting of scenes on the stone canvasses of caves, the holding of ceremonial rites in temples, or the elaboration of the human story through the fount of theater, humans have craved and crafted virtual-world experiences from the dawn of artistic and linguistic expression.''}~\cite{Damer2014}
\end{quote}

Within this thesis we are concerned with those alternate realities that through means of computers or other apparatus modify, mediate or create the environmental stimuli received by a subject's senses. While some alternate reality endeavours have explored the mediation of multiple human senses, from Morton Heilig's 1950's `Sensorama' experience that presented its occupant with a motorcyle ride through combination of film, sound, wind, vibration and odor~\cite{Rheingold1992}, to present day experiences that combine multiple computer generated sensory data such as the Birdly full body flight simulator\footnote{\url{http://birdly.zhdk.ch/}}, many are focussed upon visual stimuli alone, with other senses suspended or separated, bracketed into a \textit{``different stream of awareness''}~\cite{Adams2014}.

\begin{quote}
	\textit{``Sight plays such a prominent part in the mental life that the field of vision is sometimes considered almost synonymous with the field of attention.''}~\cite{Lucas1951}
\end{quote}

The 1990s saw a surge of interest around \textit{virtual reality}, promising to immerse users via a head mounted display (HMD) into 3D virtual environments. However with hardware and software simply not advanced enough to meet the hype generated by the news and media, the virtual reality bubble burst and it was subsequently largely ignored as a consumer platform for gaming and media consumption.

The advent and mass adoption of the smartphone beginning in the early 2000s, with its combination of location sensing (GPS) and orientation sensing (accelerometer and gyroscope) capabilities in a portable package with a screen, camera and Internet access, led to a surge of \textit{augmented reality} applications, which overlaid virtual objects and data upon the view of the real world captured by the phone's rear-facing camera.

The early 2000s also saw the rise of a next generation of persistent multi-user virtual environments, self proclaimed `virtual worlds', with a focus on 3D3C (3D, Community, Creation and Commerce)~\cite{Sevan2008}, including Second Life\footnote{\url{http://secondlife.com/}} from Linden Lab and its open source implementation OpenSim\footnote{\url{http://opensimulator.org/}}. The scientific research potential of these virtual worlds~\cite{Bainbridge2007} led to numerous projects that explored their utility for subjects as diverse as education~\cite{Allison2012}, virtual heritage~\cite{Kennedy2013}, building automation systems\footnote{\url{http://www.ugotrade.com/2007/07/02/eolus-makes-leap-to-3d-internet-on-second-life/}}, data centre visualisation\footnote{\url{http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/23565.wss}} and standards design~\cite{Gelissen2011a}, amongst others.

One such project, led by Joshua Lifton at MIT's Media Lab, introduced \textit{cross reality} as a new category of alternate reality in which the real world and a virtual environment (in this case provided by Second Life) were connected by sensor and actuator infrastructure, allowing bidirectional exchange of media and control information between the two environments, such that actions and events in one could manifest in the other~\cite{Lifton2007a}. This endeavour aimed to mitigate what Lifton identified as the \textit{vacancy problem}, which described how a person interacting with a virtual environment becomes unaware of their real environment and vice versa, by virtue of not having \textit{``the means to be in more than one place (reality) at a time''}.

The vacancy problem remains an important consideration as we move rapidly into a world where the ubiquity of technology, wireless communications and the explosive popularity of social networking services (SNS) heralds the coming of an era in which maintaining a virtual presence (whether 3D or on Facebook) while continuing to function in the real world becomes not just desirable, but the norm, creating instances of \textit{polysocial reality}~\cite{Applin2012} wherever we go.

It is here in the story of alternate realities that this thesis enters. Taking one of the core concepts of cross reality, that of tandem real and a virtual environments both complete unto themselves, and extending it to allow the user to engage \textit{visually} with both environments wherever within them they may be, gives rise to parallel reality. With the recent resurgence of interest in HMD based virtual reality, thanks largely to the introduction by Oculus\footnote{\url{https://www.oculus.com/}} of their Rift developer kits that leverage advances in display technology to overcome the shortfalls of the 90s virtual reality fad, and the introduction of novel smartphone based indoor positioning technology from IndoorAtlas\footnote{\url{https://www.indooratlas.com/}}, the \textit{Mirrorshades} parallel reality platform was developed and evaluated as a first foray into this exciting new take on our realities. Where cross reality permitted users an indirect insight into the other environment by means of sensors and actuators, parallel reality grants them the ability to switch between direct visual engagement with each environment - to at one moment view their real surroundings and at the next to view the equivalent vantage in the immersive parallel virtual environment.

\section{Contributions}
\label{intro-contributions}
The contributions of this thesis can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The introduction of parallel reality as a new category of alternate reality that allows users to experience complete real and virtual environments in tandem and represents an avenue for further mitigation of the vacancy problem.
	\item The framing of parallel reality through a thorough investigation and extension of previous taxonomies that classify and distinguish between alternate reality terminologies.
	\item The presentation of the combined Milgram/Waterworth model for visualising alternate reality experiences, including those of parallel reality systems.
	\item Development of a preliminary parallel reality platform, the Virtual Time Window, through extension of the Second Life client.
	\item Development of a second parallel reality platform, dubbed Mirrorshades, that combines new virtual reality hardware with novel indoor positioning technology.
	\item Evaluation of the Mirrorshades platform through user studies of a real world use case study within the realm of cultural heritage, including the discussion and application of an established presence questionnaire to a parallel reality experience.
	\item Creation and discussion of a set of best practices for future parallel reality endeavours.
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives and Methodology}

The design and development of a new category of alternate reality naturally requires a thorough comprehension and understanding of existing theoretical frameworks. However to ascertain the worth of a new alternate reality it is all but imperative that it be explored through instantiation, with real world deployment to study users' behaviour, reactions and performance. It is a fundamental tenet of alternate reality experience that somebody actually \textit{have} the experience in order for there to be something to base an assessment upon. While predictions and educated extrapolations can be made about the nature of such an experience, through study of the results and observations of previous scenarios in related contexts, assessment of a new alternate reality requires that it be deployed and not remain a thought experiment or theoretical framework.

\begin{quote}
	\textit{``There are circumstances where the best or only way to shed light on a proposition, a principle, a material, a process or a function is to attempt to construct something, or to enact something, calculated to explore, embody or test it.''}~\cite{Archer1995}
\end{quote}



Parallel reality aims to further address the vacancy problem, originally coined by Joshua Lifton, by allowing users to switch freely between equivalent vantage points in two complete environments, one real and the other virtual. While the cross reality systems developed by Lifton succeeded in addressing the `absence' of a person from one environment while participating in the other by introducing changes into one environment based upon triggers in the other, the ability to visually engage with both environments in the true sense of being \textit{``in more than one place (reality) at a time''}



\ref{chapter-background}
The approach to this investigation involved first developing a well defined set of definitions for different alternate realities, in order to correctly situate the new paradigm of parallel reality against them and to inform its implementation from the findings and advice of other previously established alternate reality paradigms and their real world investigations.




The worth of the parallel reality paradigm however, cannot truly be assessed through purely theoretical means. While one can postulate as to the experiential aspects of such a system and how they will affect particular tasks and scenarios, it is only through actual creation and application that such postulations can be corroborated or refuted.

Thus after the creation of a strong theoretical foundation of alternate reality taxonomy and experience, an approach of practice-based research, specifically `research through practice'~\cite{Chynoweth2014}, was adopted in order to develop actual parallel reality systems which could then be applied to real world user studies to allow collection of empirical evidence in the real world.


\ref{chapter-vtw} \ref{chapter-mirrorshades}
First the Virtual Time Window platform explored the potential suitability of an existing alternate reality modality to serve as a platform for the investigation of parallel reality experience and subsequently the Mirrorshades platform was developed as an entirely new modality to better realise the envisaged experience of parallel reality.


\ref{chapter-eval-1}
The measure of success for this platform was based upon a comparison to previously explored alternate reality experiences in similar settings, by application to a use case within the field of virtual heritage, comparing a seated virtual reality experience of virtual reconstructions of heritage content against the same content experienced as part of a parallel reality.

\ref{chapter-eval-2}
With the success of the platform strongly indicated by these user studies, further study was undertaken to shed light onto how different aspects of the implementation of a parallel reality experience either negatively or positively affected the user experience, allowing for the construction of a set of best practice recommendations for future parallel reality endeavours.



requiring the development of the combined Milgram/Waterworth model to sufficiently illustrate and understand the experiential aspect of the system, as it is different to anything that came before



The fundamental research objectives addressed by this thesis are thus:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introduce the parallel reality concept by situating it within the larger ecosystem of alternate realities, through a thorough exploration of existing alternate reality definitions, taxonomies and frameworks, updating those where required.
	
	\item Develop a suitable model for the illustration of experience in parallel reality scenarios, allowing not only for comparison and contrast between parallel reality and other alternate reality experiences, but also for illustration of different parallel reality implementations.
	
	\item Develop a parallel reality system suitable for deployment to real world user studies to effect comparison against previous alternate reality experiences.
	
	\item Identify and effect suitable assessment approaches to ascertain the worth of parallel reality in comparison to previous alternate reality experience.
	
	\item Identify aspects of a parallel reality system that are expected to positively or negatively effect the user experience, along with assessment methodologies to ascertain such effects and apply these to real world user studies.
	
\end{enumerate}

\section{Document Overview}

Chapter \ref{chapter-background} surveys the ecosystem of alternate realities, including methods and taxonomies for classifying, categorising and distinguishing between different alternate reality terms, in order to frame the introduction of the parallel reality concept against existing techniques. Chapter \ref{chapter-vtw} describes the development of an initial tablet based parallel reality system, the Virtual Time Window, while chapter \ref{chapter-mirrorshades} details the development of the Mirrorshades HMD based parallel reality platform. Chapters \ref{chapter-eval-1} and \ref{chapter-eval-2} cover the investigation of the Mirrorshades platform through user studies at a cultural heritage site, the former comparing parallel reality against a more traditional scenario in which virtual reality has already come to be used at such sites and the latter investigating the benefits and drawbacks to different manners of parallel reality implementation, resulting in a set of best practice recommendations. Finally chapter \ref{chapter-conclusions} concludes the body of work and postulates on avenues for further investigation into the parallel reality concept.
