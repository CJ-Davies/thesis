\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Content -} Short (10 pages is probably far too long) example or usage scenario of how the concepts investigated in the thesis have/could be used (a `near-future usage scenario').
	\item \textbf{What has been done -} Nothing.
	\item \textbf{What is left to do/how long should it take -} Come up with a legitimate scenario, keep it short, should probably be written after the bulk of the later sections so there's a clear idea of what scenario I actually want to allude to. Perhaps a few days writing.
\end{itemize}
