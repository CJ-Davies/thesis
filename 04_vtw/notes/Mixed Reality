Design of information landscapes for cultural heritage content

\cite{Ruffaldi2008}

Presenting all sorts of heritage information (including 2D resources) in an immersive (CAVE) environment via 'information landscapes'. Not really an alternate reality, but still a use of immersive/CAVE technologies in heritage.

Presentation of a virtual environment as something available for both desktop & immersive
visualisations. Construction of such 'information landscapes' requires preliminary design
effort by some developer.

In the related work section, mentions large scale (city scale) virtual reproductions &
several examples of 3D virtual cultural heritage using various technologies (some even
allowing haptic interfaces) finally mentioning the existence of many virtual cultural
heritage things in Second Life ('applications of real-time 3D graphics... ...which need
dedicated clients').

Explains that virtual reality does not anchor to physical reality - 3D environments can
be entirely synthetic, can model a real world location or a museum that doesn't exist in
the real world at all.
