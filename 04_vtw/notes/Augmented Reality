Augmented reality tour system for immersive experience of cultural heritage

\cite{Kim2009}

Visual knowledge of a target scene has been employed to allow rendering of 3D virtual characters atop real views of Sajeongjeon and Gangnyeongjeon of Gyeongbokgung, representative of cultural heritage sites in Korea, without the need for additional sensors, by visually tracking a rectangular structure within the environment whose corners represented robust features for visual tracking.

AR Cultural Heritage Reconstruction Based on Feature Landmark Database Constructed by Using Omnidirectional Range Sensor

\cite{Taketomi2011}

The use of omnidirectional range sensing for registration of real \& virtual content at cultural heritage sites has been explored, combining these close local shapes aquired from rangefinding with a landmark database of the large scale environment to achieve accurate registration for AR sightnseeing in historic sites.
