Comparing Real & Synthetic Scenes using Human Judgements of Lightness

\cite{mcnamara:lightness}

Compares how realistic computer generated scenes are compared to their real counterparts, by creating a scene & lighting it in the real world & creating a computer simulation of the same & asking participants to classify the two according to some system.

"...the ultimate goal being to create images which are perceptually indistinguishable from an actual scene."

Rendering of large and complex urban environments for real time heritage reconstructions

\cite{willmott:largecomplex}

Presents a rendering package with heavy focus on optimizations such as not rendering buildings
that are obscured by buildings in front of them, rendering buildings features like windows into
the wall textures so from a distance it looks as though the windows are there so they only need to
actually be rendered at closer range & the difference is less noticeable.

Talks about importance of performance optimizations for real time heritage, which is pertinent to VTW but VTW doesn't have any of these optimizations!

Photorealism and Non-Photorealism in Virtual Heritage Representation

\cite{roussou:photorealism}

Definition of virtual heritage - "Virtual heritage, broadly defined, involves the synthesis, conservation, reproduction, representation, digital reprocessing, and display of cultural evidence with the use of advanced imaging technology."

"...virtual heritage has long been concentrated on generating digital reconstructions of historical or
archaeological artefacts and sites with enough fidelity to be truly accurate representations of their real world counterparts."

Contrasts between photorealistic & non-photorealistic computer graphics and that for some users the realism isn't the most important factor, but rather how believeable & convincing it is, regardless if the imagery emulates the physical properties of the real world or not. More 'artistic' means of expression can that do not necessarily hold true to a photographic view of a site can nonetheless be important to a user's understanding.

"In virtual heritage representation, architectural walkthroughs and picture-perfect simulations of objects have defined a practice where photorealism is considered as perhaps the most important measure of a successful representation."

But...

"...the emphasis on achieving a high degree of realism runs the risk of limiting VR reconstruction to the creation of historically accurate yet static worlds that leave little flexibility for interpretive and/or educational use."

So advanced realistic modelling techniques are good for accuracy & authenticity, but non-photorealistic methods can provide appropriate tools for more flexible uses in virtual heritage applications. This paper tries to combine both photorealism & interactivity into the same virtual reality framework under the CREATE project.

"...heritage is 'as much about the living and evolving place, people, and environment as it is about any single static monument'"

"In the case of an archaeology scholar who intends to restore the ancient monument, the goal is to offer the possibility to try varied reconstruction hypotheses and choose the most plausible."

High fidelity reconstruction of the ancient Egyptian temple of Kalabsha

\cite{Sundstedt2004}

Talks about the importance of accuracy to archaeology & the practical methodology that should be adopted to create a truly high fidelity reconstruction of an archaeological site, paying particular interest to the accuracy of the lighting (measuring emission spectra of different oils burning & everything!). Spurred by the fact that "there are very few high fidelity reconstructions that attempt to authentically represent how a site may have been perceived in the past. Crucial to this accurate perception is the need to correctly model the ancient lighting."

Most self-defined virtual worlds (eg Second Life, OpenSim, etc.) don't have complex enough rendering/lighitng engines for this (except Avatar Reality, based on some version of CryEngine).

Used Maya in combination with Radiance, a suite of tools for lighting simulation. Allows archaeologists to determine how light would have fallen on different parts of structures in their original (non-ruined) conditions & in their original locations (the Kalabsha was moved) to make new discoveries about the role of light in these structures.

3D modeling of complex and detailed cultural heritage using multi-resolution data

\cite{Remondino2009}

Virtual digitization of the Great Inscription of Gortyna, Crete, using several different
digitizing techniques/equipments at different resolutions (more detailed the closer to the
area of interest, etc.).

Game based technology to enhance the learning of history and cultural heritage

\cite{deamicis:gamebased}

Major good quote for VR (\& thus PR) vs AR!!! - 'atmosphere & immersion'

Abstract only that talks about the use of game technologies to support learning of users
within cultural heritage sites.

Says that the level of realism is ideal to visualise cultural
heritage if a string focus on the environment's atmosphere \& immersion is required, "emphasising
environmental effects such as fog, sky, water, particles", all of which self-proclaimed virtual
worlds aren't as good at.
        
Uses Unity3D! Mentions that it can produce web browser based applications as well as standalone
ones, has a simple authoring interface \& "exploits the latest graphical hardware by making extensive
use of shaders to deliver high quality graphics".
