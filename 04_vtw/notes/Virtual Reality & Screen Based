A versatile large-scale multimodal VR system for cultural heritage visualization

Leveraging a model of an ancient Greek templed in Messene created as part of the CREATE project, a system made use of a CAVE-like theatre, consisting of head-tracked user localization, a 2-armed haptic interface with realistic physics engine \& 3D sound, to host large scale visualizations of cultural heritage sites. Initial user studies into the usability \& performance of the system employed a simple task to ascertain the benefit (if any) of the haptic interface, while an additional qualitative study of the final system took place while it was installed in a museum~\cite{Christou2006}.

\textbf{***Useful quote for the shortcomings of self-proclaimed virtual worlds - "Such environments suffer
either from a lack of realism or a low degree of interactivity, due to technological and
methodological constraints.".}
