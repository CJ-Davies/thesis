Information and communication technologies are in constant development; they progress worldwide and across sectors. Their applications in tourism and tourist resources is rapidly increasing, reaching new, innovative and sometimes amazing results in terms of effectiveness, productivity, quality, and customer satisfaction. Exploring the interaction between technologies and tourism is difficult and challenging. Specifically, using virtual world technologies as a new means of information for potential tourists is a big challenge where the actual methods, goals and needs still need to be exactly identified. This paper aims at analyzing why and how virtual worlds can become an important platform for tourism-oriented areas to promote a destination in general, and their local heritage and tourist added-value services in particular. The document will also introduce the design of the first prototypes and the validation results of the four specific technologies tested at the Virtual Travel Use Case (Soundscape generation, Multilinguality, Video streaming and Path and Camera Planning). Finally, the contribution to the MPEG-V standard will also be detailed in the paper.},

We tried to create a partly-automatic system, which was aimed at producing a realistic model of the geometry and architectural style of the district, rather than an exact reconstruction of every detail. The residential buildings of the particular area follow some well defined architectural styles, which allows us to follow an automatic building generation, based on the 2D digital data and a library of predefined 3D building blocks. Starting from the GIS file, the data is sorted, examined and processed to detect the houses features and style as accurately as possible. The 3D model is then constructed by stitching together the appropriate blocks from the component library. Besides the automatic-generation method, we have used ImageModeler from RealViz to create accurate 3D representations of landmarks and exceptional buildings as well as for the building blocks.},

@article{Getchell2010,
abstract = {The construction and consolidation of knowledge through the practical application of concepts and processes can be difficult to support for subjects where practice is an integral component of competence and expertise in that domain. For example, participation in an archaeological excavation is not readily available to students, although a detailed understanding of what processes this involves is deemed to be core to the subject. The Laconia Acropolis Virtual Archaeology (LAVA) project has created a cooperative exploratory learning environment that addresses the need for students to engage with the complex practice of excavation. By leveraging the progressive nature of games methodologies and the immersive engagement provided by 3D multiuser virtual environments, LAVA facilitates the adoption of exploratory learning for excavation scenarios which have previously been inaccessible due to barriers of travel, time, and cost. A virtual environment based on real world data has been developed where groups of users are faced with a series of dynamic challenges with which they engage until such time that a certain level of competence is shown. Once a series of domain-specific objectives has been met, users are able to progress forward to the next level of the simulation. The excavation simulator enhances the student learning experience by providing opportunities for students to engage with the process in a customizable, virtual environment. Not only does this provide students with an opportunity to put the theories they are familiar with into practice, but it also allows students to gain experience in applying their skills in a bid to manage an excavation process, thereby making it possible for a greater emphasis to be placed on the practical application of knowledge that the excavation process necessitates. The potential of this approach has been confirmed by a positive user evaluation. LAVA contributes toward the progress of technology-enhanced learning by illustrating the- - instantiation of a framework which demonstrates how to integrate games methods with learning management systems and virtual worlds in order to support higher order learning behaviors such as applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating.},

The hope is that we can avoid some of the complexities the Web has encountered by learning how to build applications and services before they are subject to the short-term necessities of commercial development. While Meru cannot compete with the content creation of commercial virtual worlds, it can, like the original World Wide Web at CERN, investigate basic questions about system design. By doing so, the door can be opened to a future where physical sensors in the real world seed their virtual reflections, users can visually browse a sea of information, and virtual avatars convey physical social cues to bring distance interaction to the level of actual presence.},

abstract = {The IEEE 1451 smart transducer interface standards provide the common interface and enabling technology for the connectivity of transducers to microprocessors, control and field networks, and data acquisition and instrumentation systems. The standardized TEDS specified by IEEE 1451.2 allows the self-description of sensors and the interfaces provide a standardized mechanism to facilitate the “Plug and play ” of sensors to networks. The network-independent smart transducer object model defined by IEEE 1451.1 allows sensor manufacturers to support multiple networks and protocols. Thus, transducer-to-network interoperability is on the horizon. The inclusion of P1451.3 and P1451.4 to the family of 1451 standards will meet the needs of the analog transducer users for high-speed applications. In the long run, transducer vendors and users, system integrators, and network providers can all benefit from the IEEE 1451 interface standards},

Four types of real world disability impact functioning in virtual worlds: keyboard/mouse; print; hearing/speech; and cognitive. Some virtual worlds include accessibility features, such as resizable UI elements and fonts. Alternative keyboards and mice usually work adequately in virtual worlds. However, common text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and screen reader software doesn't interface well with virtual worlds. Existing accessibility guidelines and legislation (Universal Design, Internet accessibility standards and guidelines, and online game accessibility guidelines) might be applicable to virtual worlds. Practical limitations to implementation of these solutions include their complexity and cost. As government agencies, universities, and employers increase their use of virtual worlds, specific standards for virtual world accessibility, including interfacing with common assistive technology, need to be created and enforced.},

Lifton's PhD thesis, essentially the inaugural piece of work on cross
reality. He called it 'dual reality' at this point but it's exactly the
same thing (which he confirms). Has probably the very first
definition of dual reality, definition of sensor networks/ubicomp/VWs,
identifies the bidirectional nature of cross reality, discusses mapping
between real \& virtual (whether it should be one-to-one or not), has a
survey of the earliest projects that did augmented virtuality, reference
to the 'second earth' concept, introduces the concept of 'virtual
sensing' which is a much better way to go about controlling actuation
from within the VW, identifies the platform-dependency of the Plug but
mentions that there is not much to stop it from being adapted to
different platforms, identifies that HTTP is pretty much the only means
of communicating with SL because XML-RPC is so useless, identifies the
lack of a standard middleware (with which to compare Plug etc. against),
mentions people maintaining an online presence, identifies that this
piece of work is 'framing dual reality as a new application domain for
sensor networks, virtual words \& media creation' \& identifies the
importance of automatic support to identify phenomena based on readings
from multiple sensed modalities.

abstract = {This paper focuses on Mixed Reality (MR) visual displays, a particular subset of Virtual Reality (VR) related technologies that involve the merging of real and virtual worlds somewhere along the "virtuality continuum" which connects completely real environments to completely virtual ones. Probably the best known of these is Augmented Reality (AR), which refers to all cases in which the display of an otherwise real environment is augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects. The converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display environments are identified. However, an attempt to distinguish these classes on the basis of whether they are primarily video or computer graphics based, whether the real world is viewed directly or via some electronic display medium, whether the viewer is intended to feel part of the world or on the outside looking in, and whether or not the scale of the display is intended to map orthoscopically onto the real world leads to quite different groupings among the six identified classes, thereby demonstrating the need for an efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to which essential differences can be identified. The 'obvious' distinction between the terms "real" and "virtual" is shown to have a number of different aspects, depending on whether one is dealing with real or virtual objects, real or virtual images, and direct or non-direct viewing of these. An (approximately) three dimensional taxonomy is proposed, comprising the following dimensions: Extent of World Knowledge ("how much do we know about the world being displayed?"), Reproduction Fidelity ("how 'realistically' are we able to display it?"), and Extent of Presence Metaphor ("what is the extent of the illusion that the observer is present within that world?").},

============

        

        
Brief introduction to mixed reality \& to the virtuality continuum
between completely real environments \& completely virtual environments.

        
Identifies 3 aspects that distinguish between real \& virtual;
> extent of world knowledge
	"how much do we know about the world being displayed?"
	world unmodelled (computer knows nothing about the contents of the
	environment) to world completely modelled (traditional virtual real-
	-ity where the computer has complete knowledge about each object in
	the environment)
> reproduction fidelity
	"how realistically are we able to display it?"
	pertains to both real \& virtual objects
> extent of prescence metaphor
	"what is the extent of the illusion that the observer is present
	within that world?"
	mixed reality displays include highly immersive environments with a
	strong presence metaphor, but also exocentric type AR displays

        
Identifies 6 different types of display technology that constitute mixed
reality interfaces.

        
Contains diagrams of virtuality continuum, extent of world knowledge,
reproduction fidelity \& extent of presence metaphor (all linear).

Currently these two are not capable of exchanging information, largely because of the lack of a global accepted standard for information exchange.

We present a Use Case in the Metaverse1 project to increase motivation for continued physical exercising for the elderly by connecting real-world devices to virtual worlds, and allow information exchange through the teleportation of virtual objects from Second Life to our custom virtual biking world created in the Logos3D engine. We show that the principle of exchanging information between real and virtual worlds is simple, but the solution is non-trivial and requires not only a globally accepted standard to facilitate information exchange. From the results of a focus-group study, we show that a virtual environment does have the capability to increase motivation for exercising and that users do respond to a virtual exercise coach.},

         - Maria Roussou, George Drettakis )

        
        
Definition of virtual heritage - "Virtual heritage, broadly defined, involves the synthesis, conservation,
reproduction, representation, digital reprocessing, and display of cultural evidence with the use of
advanced imaging technology."

        
"...virtual heritage has long been concentrated on generating digital reconstructions of historical or
archaeological artefacts and sites with enough fidelity to be truly accurate representations of their real
world counterparts."

        
Contrasts between photorealistic \& non-photorealistic computer graphics and that for some users the realism
isn't the most important factor, but rather how believeable \& convincing it is, regardless if the imagery
emulates the physical properties of the real world or not. More 'artistic' means of expression can that do
not necessarily hold true to a photographic view of a site can nonetheless be important to a user's understanding.

        
"In virtual heritage representation, architectural walkthroughs and picture-perfect simulations of objects
have defined a practice where photorealism is considered as perhaps the most important measure of a
successful representation."

        
But...

        
"...the emphasis on achieving a high degree of realism runs the risk of limiting VR reconstruction to the
creation of historically accurate yet static worlds that leave little flexibility for interpretive and/or
educational use."

        
So advanced realistic modelling techniques are good for accuracy \& authenticity, but non-photorealistic methods
can provide appropriate tools for more flexible uses in virtual heritage applications. This paper tries to
combine both photorealism \& interactivity into the same virtual reality framework under the CREATE project.

        
"...heritage is 'as much about the living and evolving place, people, and environment as it is about any
single static monument'"

        
"In the case of an archaeology scholar who intends to restore the ancient monument, the goal is to offer
the possibility to try varied reconstruction hypotheses and choose the most plausible."

abstract = {In this paper, a theoretical model of effective team collaboration in 3D virtual environments is presented. The aim of this model is to enhance our understanding of the capabilities exerting influence on effective 3D virtual team collaboration. The model identifies a number of specific capabilities of 3D virtual worlds that can contribute to this team effectiveness. Compared to "traditional" computer-mediated collaboration technologies, 3D virtual environments support team collaboration primarily through (a) the shared virtual environment, and (b) avatar-based interaction. Through the shared virtual environment, users experience higher levels of presence (a feeling of actually "being there"), realism and interactivity. These capabilities increase the users' level of information processing. Avatar-based interaction induces greater feelings of social presence (being with others) and control over self-presentation (how one wants to be perceived by others), thus increasing the level of communication support in the 3D environment. Through greater levels of information and communication support, a higher level of shared understanding is reached, which in turn positively influences team performance. Our paper concludes by presenting several propositions which allow further empirical testing, implications for research and practice, and suggestions for future research. The insights obtained from this paper can help developers of these virtual worlds to design standards for the capabilities that influence effective team collaboration in 3D virtual environments.},

abstract = {Considers present and future practical applications of cross-reality. From tools to build new 3D virtual worlds to the products of those tools, cross-reality is becoming a staple of our everyday reality. Practical applications of cross-reality include the ability to virtually visit a factory to manage and maintain resources from the comfort of your laptop or desktop PC as well as sentient visors that augment reality with additional information so that users can make more informed choices. Tools and projects considered are:Project Wonderland for multiuser mixed reality;ClearWorlds: mixed- reality presence through virtual clearboards; VICI (Visualization of Immersive and Contextual Information) for ubiquitous augmented reality based on a tangible user interface; Mirror World Chocolate Factory; and sentient visors for browsing the world.},
annote = {Briefly discusses 5 current \& future applications of cross reality,
however by my definitions none of these 5 are cross reality but just
augmented reality or augmented virtuality. The chocolate factory example
is however interesting - taking real time sensor data from the real
factory \& using it to update a virtual simulation of the factory.},
