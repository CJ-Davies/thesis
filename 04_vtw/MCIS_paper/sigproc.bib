Augmented Duality: Overlapping a Metaverse with the Real World
Mark Wright et al
2008

Presents several example implementations of overlapping Second Life with
the real world (camera phones, 2-way large screen, etc.) which they ref-
-er to as 'dual reality' but is essentially analagous to cross reality.

Reference for simulating real world locations being an application for
virtual worlds.

Professor at University of Toronoto, responsible for coming up with the
virtuality continuum in all of its different versions. Provides some
fairly high-level theoretical discussion of what distinguishes the
different alternate realities that computer science has come to explore,
including how to determine whether an environment is augmented reality
or augmented virtuality (eg at what point does a scene stop being
augmented reality & become augmented virtuality, etc.).

A Taxonomy of Mixed Reality Visual Displays
Paul Milgram & Fumio Kishino
1994

Brief introduction to mixed reality & to the virtuality continuum
between completely real environments & completely virtual environments.

Identifies 3 aspects that distinguish between real & virtual;
> extent of world knowledge
	"how much do we know about the world being displayed?"
	world unmodelled (computer knows nothing about the contents of the
	environment) to world completely modelled (traditional virtual real-
	-ity where the computer has complete knowledge about each object in
	the environment)
> reproduction fidelity
	"how realistically are we able to display it?"
	pertains to both real & virtual objects
> extent of prescence metaphor
	"what is the extent of the illusion that the observer is present
	within that world?"
	mixed reality displays include highly immersive environments with a
	strong presence metaphor, but also exocentric type AR displays

Identifies 6 different types of display technology that constitute mixed
reality interfaces.

Contains diagrams of virtuality continuum, extent of world knowledge,
reproduction fidelity & extent of presence metaphor (all linear).

Definition of virtual reality.

MIT's Media Laboratory (particularly the Responsive Environments group
under the leadership of Joseph Paradiso) was responsible for essentially
the inaugural work in cross reality, with Joshua Lifton's PhD & the
associated projects in the group framing 'dual reality', as it was
originally known, as a new application domain for sensor/actuator
networks, virtual worlds & media creation. Lifton himself confirms that
cross reality & dual reality are the same thing by different names [29].

Dual Reality: An Emerging Medium
Joshua Lifton
2007

Lifton's PhD thesis, essentially the inaugural piece of work on cross
reality. He called it 'dual reality' at this point but it's exactly the
same thing (which he confirms in [29]). Has probably the very first
definition of dual reality, definition of sensor networks/ubicomp/VWs,
identifies the bidirectional nature of cross reality, discusses mapping
between real & virtual (whether it should be one-to-one or not), has a
survey of the earliest projects that did augmented virtuality, reference
to the 'second earth' concept, introduces the concept of 'virtual
sensing' which is a much better way to go about controlling actuation
from within the VW, identifies the platform-dependency of the Plug but
mentions that there is not much to stop it from being adapted to
different platforms, identifies that HTTP is pretty much the only means
of communicating with SL because XML-RPC is so useless, identifies the
lack of a standard middleware (with which to compare Plug etc. against),
mentions people maintaining an online presence, identifies that this
piece of work is 'framing dual reality as a new application domain for
sensor networks, virtual words & media creation' & identifies the
importance of automatic support to identify phenomena based on readings
from multiple sensed modalities.

Consumer Adoption of Cross Reality Systems
Joshua Lifton
7-10 July 2010

Retrospective piece written by Lifton after moving from academia (MIT)
to industry (Electric Sheep Company) & then on to consultant & educator.
Lists observations of what has marred the wider uptake of cross reality.

> Second Life failed to achieve the consumer uptake it promised
> Adoption of hardware required for cross reality is slow; even now we
only have a smattering of sensors in common use (passport RFID, mobile
phone location/orientation, body-gesture in games consoles)
> Virtual worlds do not allow as much expression of identity as online
social networks, soon social networks may begin to fit the bill of VWs

Confirmation from Lifton himself that 'dual reality' & 'cross reality'
are the same thing under different names.

Through Tinted Eyeglasses
Roy Want
July - September 2009

Introduction to the issue about cross reality, tries to define the
different types of alternate realities (VR, AR, ER, MR) but I believe
his definition of cross reality to be wrong (he describes what I
consider augmented virtuality).

Features a 2x2 matrix that shows the relation between the different
alternate realities. Where he has cross reality (top left) I would place
augmented virtuality.

Event Processing Support for Cross-Reality Environments
Nihal Dindar et al
July - September 2009

Discusses the importance of higher level inference techniques to make
sense of phenomena detected by sensor networks, presenting it as an
essential functionality of cross reality environments. Lifton touched
on such a thing in his PhD, talking about how looking at vibration data
could tell you whether a lamp was plugged in before being turned on etc.

Presents DejaVu, an event processing system, that works along with an
example cross reality application that feeds real world RFID data into
a virtual library in Second Life.

Scaling Virtual Worlds with a Physical Metaphor
Daniel Horn et al
July - September 2009

Talks about the scalability problems of todays virtual worlds (both
self proclaimed 'virtual worlds' like Second Life & online games like
WoW & Eve Online). Proposes the Meru Project (Stanford) as a virtual
world architecture that can scale to global scales by modelling the
virtual world after the real world - eg using distance to determine the
detail/bandwidth with which to render an object.

Envisages cross reality by a special 'space zero' within which physical
objects can register themselves & thus advertise their presence &
location to users of the virtual world. Nice example of a real person
walking down a street in the real world & an avatar's position in space
zero being updated by GPS, with shop owners who have registered their
shops with space zero able to advertise specials to the avatar.

Also makes the point that, just like with the real web, it won't always
be actual users observing the virtual world, it may well be scripts/bots
that, for example, comb/search through specials.

Building and Employing Cross-Reality
Joseph Anthony (editor)
July - September 2009

Briefly discusses 5 current & future applications of cross reality,
however by my definitions none of these 5 are cross reality but just
augmented reality or augmented virtuality. The chocolate factory example
is however interesting - taking real time sensor data from the real
factory & using it to update a virtual simulation of the factory.

Research on digital preservation of cultural assets (in this case statues of Buddha) &
digital restoration of their original appearance. Gets very maths-ey.

An experience using X3D for Virtual Cultural Heritage
Cabral et al.
2007

Using 3D virtual reality technologies to accurately reconstruct & further explore ancient
& historic city buildings (which may not exist any more). The X3D standard is an ISO standard
XML-based file format for representing 3D computer graphics & is the successor to VRML.

Claims to have created & visualised an entire city.

Definition of 'virtual cultural heritage' - "The field of Virtual Cultural Heritage refers
to the use of virtual systems to generate, navigate and explore reconstructed environments
that are of cultural interest."

Used Maya for creating the models (before exporting to X3D). Praises the X3D standard's ability
to use complex lighting etc. (argument for Unity etc in place of traditional virtual worlds?).

Also an argument that 'virtuality' implies three dimensional, which is an argument that cross
reality must use a 3D virtual environment, not 2D map view or anything like that.

Game based technology to enhance the learning of history and cultural heritage

Abstract only that talks about the use of game technologies to support learning of users
within cultural heritage sites. Says that the level of realism is ideal to visualise cultural
heritage if a string focus on the environment's atmosphere & immersion is required, "emphasising
environmental effects such as fog, sky, water, particles", all of which self-proclaimed virtual
worlds aren't as good at.

Uses Unity3D! Mentions that it can produce web browser based applications as well as standalone
ones, has a simple authoring interface & "exploits the latest graphical hardware by making extensive
use of shaders to deliver high quality graphics".

Design of Information Landscapes for Cultural Heritage Content
Emanuele Ruffaldi et al.
2008

Presentation of a virtual environment as something available for both desktop & immersive
visualisations. Construction of such 'information landscapes' requires preliminary design
effort by some developer.

In the related work section, mentions large scale (city scale) virtual reproductions &
several examples of 3D virtual cultural heritage using various technologies (some even
allowing haptic interfaces) finally mentioning the existence of many virtual cultural
heritage things in Second Life ('applications of real-time 3D graphics... ...which need
dedicated clients').

Explains that virtual reality does not anchor to physical reality - 3D environments can
be entirely synthetic, can model a real world location or a museum that doesn't exist in
the real world at all.

High Fidelity Reconstruction of the Ancient Egyptian Temple of Kalabsha
Veronica Sundstedt et al.

Talks about the importance of accuracy to archaeology & the practical methodology that should be adopted to
create a truly high fidelity reconstruction of an archaeological site, paying particular interest to the
accuracy of the lighting (measuring emission spectra of different oils burning & everything!). Spurred by the
fact that "there are very few high fidelity reconstructions that attempt to authentically represent how a
site may have been perceived in the past. Crucial to this accurate perception is the need to correctly
model the ancient lighting."

Most self-defined virtual worlds (eg Second Life, OpenSim, etc.) don't have complex enough rendering/lighitng
engines for this (except Avatar Reality, based on some version of CryEngine).

Used Maya in combination with Radiance, a suite of tools for lighting simulation. Allows archaeologists to
determine how light would have fallen on different parts of structures in their original (non-ruined) conditions
& in their original locations (the Kalabsha was moved) to make new discoveries about the role of light in
these structures.

Presents a rendering package with heavy focus on optimizations such as not rendering buildings
that are obscured by buildings in front of them, rendering buildings features like windows into
the wall textures so from a distance it looks as though the windows are there so they only need to
actually be rendered at closer range & the difference is less noticeable.

Photorealism and Non-Photo-Realism in Virtual Heritage Representation
Maria Roussou & George Drettakis

Definition of virtual heritage - "Virtual heritage, broadly defined, involves the synthesis, conservation,
reproduction, representation, digital reprocessing, and display of cultural evidence with the use of
advanced imaging technology."

"...virtual heritage has long been concentrated on generating digital reconstructions of historical or
archaeological artefacts and sites with enough fidelity to be truly accurate representations of their real
world counterparts."

Contrasts between photorealistic & non-photorealistic computer graphics and that for some users the realism
isn't the most important factor, but rather how believeable & convincing it is, regardless if the imagery
emulates the physical properties of the real world or not. More 'artistic' means of expression can that do
not necessarily hold true to a photographic view of a site can nonetheless be important to a user's understanding.

"In virtual heritage representation, architectural walkthroughs and picture-perfect simulations of objects
have defined a practice where photorealism is considered as perhaps the most important measure of a
successful representation."

But...

"...the emphasis on achieving a high degree of realism runs the risk of limiting VR reconstruction to the
creation of historically accurate yet static worlds that leave little flexibility for interpretive and/or
educational use."

So advanced realistic modelling techniques are good for accuracy & authenticity, but non-photorealistic methods
can provide appropriate tools for more flexible uses in virtual heritage applications. This paper tries to
combine both photorealism & interactivity into the same virtual reality framework under the CREATE project.

"...heritage is 'as much about the living and evolving place, people, and environment as it is about any
single static monument'"

"In the case of an archaeology scholar who intends to restore the ancient monument, the goal is to offer
the possibility to try varied reconstruction hypotheses and choose the most plausible."

Virtual Heritage: From The Research Lab To The Broad Public
Maria Roussou

Very good introduction to the use of virtual reality in the realm of heritage, lots of useful definitions.

"The use of immersive VR technology accounts almost a decade of research" (as of publication in 2000)

"a tool for the study and presentation of the past"

"the visualization of abstract concepts and ideas, spaces that are unreachable or no longer exist, or objects
that must be examined from diverse and unique points of view"

"heritage refers to the study of human activity not only through the recovery of remains, as is the case
with archaeology, but also through tradition, art & cultural evidences, narratives, etc."

"To virtualize heritage means to atcualize it digitally, to simulate it using computer graphics technology..."

Lots more, etc.

On the Creation of Standards for Interaction Between Robots and Virtual Worlds
Alex Juarez et al.

I would consider a robot to be a specific type or grouping of multiple actuators, so I wouldn't agree
that we need standards specifically for allowing communication between robots and virtual worlds, but
that a framework (such as ISO/IEC 23005) that allows media & control information to flow between real
& virtual worlds should allow for the control & interaction of virtual worlds with robots. So this is
an application of cross reality, essentially.

Universal Design: Including Everybody in Virtual World Design

A slightly strange article, talks about the importance of designing virtual worlds to be accessible
to the disabled (eg by having no steps in virtual worlds, just ramps, so that if a disabled person
represents themselves in the virtual world by an avatar restricted to a wheel chair they will still
be able to move around). Essentially an emphasis that virtual world locations should represent their
real ones accurately when it comes to access, tangentially related to the mimicing of a real world
location with a virtual environment simulation a la cross reality.

institutions collaborating in the development and implementation of open
standards for geospatial and location services. The Sensor Web
Enablement (SWE) project is a collection of such
standards for exploiting Web-connected sensor systems.

SWE aims to enable all Web and/or Internet accessible sensors
(including imaging devices such as surveillance cameras) to be
accessible and controllable via the Web, through open Web standards,
creating in effect a `sensor Web' that can be accessed in a similar
manner as to how HTML and HTTP allow access to the WWW.

IEEE 1451 is a family of Smart Transducer Interface Standards defining 
a set of open, common, network-independent communication interfaces for 
connecting transducers to microprocessors, instrumentation systems and 
control/field networks. The main goal of IEEE 1451 is to allow network 
access to standardised transducer data through a common set of 
interfaces, whether the transducers are connected to systems or 
networks via wired or wireless means.

Most of these references are (co-)authored by Kang Lee, the leader of
the Sensor Development & Application Group at the Manufacturing
Engineering Laboratory of NIST (National Institute of Standards and
Technology).

IEEE 1451: A standard in support of smart transducer networking
Kang Lee
2000

Published in 2000 when 1451.1 (common object model & interface specs for
components of a networkd smart transducer) & 1451.2 (transducers-to-NCAP
interface & TEDS for point-to-point configuration) were newly adopted
standards & 1451.3 (transducer-to-NCAP interface & TEDS using multi-drop
communication) & 1451.4 (mixed-mode interface for analog transducers
with analog & digital operating modes) were proposed standards. To put
this in context, by [21] in 2008 there was 1451.0 to 1451.7.

"... the IEEE 1451 project's aim is to reduce industry's effort to
develop and migrate to networked smart transducers"

Practical RFID + SENSOR Convergence Toward Context-Aware X-Reality
Marie Kim et al
2009

Identifies that the main challenge of integrating RFID/sensor tech with
Second Life is the heterogeneity of the hardware & thus a Ubiquitous
Sensor Middleware (USN) is needed. Presents such a USN, COSMOS, which
integrates with RFID reader networks, sensor & actuator network & shows
how it functions as part of a cross reality system. COSMOS is tested
using software simulations of hardware.

Also one of the authors who use 'x-reality' more than 'cross reality'.

Nice quote "The important point of X-reality is a conceptiual paradigm
shift from single-directional information flows to bidirectional
information flows between two worlds." etc.

SenseWeb from Microsoft Research is a system that allows peer production
of sensing applications, producing new kinds of media and applications 
over existing data networks, by allowing users to grant access to their
sensors to other remote users. The basic premise is that contributors 
deploy their own sensors or sensor networks, which might be designed 
for their own dedicated application or simply for sharing with other 
users, uploading the observations from these sensors to the SenseWeb 
system where they can then be accessed by other SenseWeb users through
an application-specific GUI. Using SenseWeb, applications can 
initiate and access sensor data streams from shared sensors across the
entire Internet.

GSN is a middleware developed by l'Ecole Polytechnique Federale de 
Lausanne (EPFL) to support the rapid and simple deployment of a wide 
range of sensor network topologies, facilitate the flexible integration 
and discovery of sensor networks and sensor data, enable fast deployment
and addition of new platforms, provide distributed querying, filtering 
and combination of sensor data and support dynamic adaptation of the 
system configuration during operation.

GSN's key abstraction is the 'virtual sensor', which abstracts from
implementation details of access to sensor data and corresponds either 
to a data stream received directly from a sensor or to a data stream 
derived from other virtual sensors. Virtual sensors can be any kind of 
data producer; actual sensors, wireless cameras, desktop computers, 
mobile phones, or even a combination of these. Each virtual sensor can 
have any number of input streams but produces exactly one output stream 
based on these input streams and some logical processing.

Paul Metzger

Describes a system that is capable of overlaying images of the real wor-

onto a real world scene, with applications for both presented.

"The merging of these two areas will result in virtual world experiences
more realistic than any available today."

"It will be quite some time before the line separating the real world &
the virtual world disappears completely. However, systems have been cre-
-ated which demonstrate thatit is possible to make the distinction betw-
-een what is real and wha tis virtual a bit more difficult to determine"
