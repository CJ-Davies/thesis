%\subsection{Alternate Realities \& Cultural Heritage}

The application of augmented reality techniques to the field of cultural heritage is particularly apt where there is still some trace of the original state of a site in the real world, upon which virtual objects, artefacts \& actors can be rendered. Many of these deployments have made use of smartphones \& tablet computers, but video see-through head-mounted displays have also been used.

%=======

The application of alternate reality techniques to cultural heritage promises particular benefits to young people, as cultural heritage sites often arouse little involvement in them, especially when the site's present day appearance bears few traces of its original stature~\cite{ardito:combining}.

%=======

Visual knowledge of a target scene has been employed to allow rendering of 3D virtual characters atop real views of Sajeongjeon and Gangnyeongjeon of Gyeongbokgung, representative of cultural heritage sites in Korea, without the need for additional sensors, by visually tracking a rectangular structure within the environment whose corners represented robust features for visual tracking~\cite{Kim2009,}. This approach addressed the inherent issues associated with tracking for augmented reality tours in cultural heritage sites due to the variation of tracking targets \& environments at such sites, by developing a visual tracking approach that can be applied to a wider range of sites~\cite{Seo2010}.

%=======

The combination of different categories of alternate reality \& multimedia techniques into a contiguous platform for building \& managing exhibitions of 3D models of artefacts accessed in museums, galleries \& via the Web has been investigated~\cite{Wojciechowski2004}. This project, which involved the use of Web3D technologies, focussed not only on the digitization \& subsequent interaction with such content to aid its preservation \& protection, but also with making these resources as widely available as possible to any interested parties (scientists, archaeologists, curators, historians \& casual citizens)~\cite{walczak:applications}.

%=======

The concepts of augmented reality \& telepresence have been combined, creating `augmented telepresence', to allow participants to experience a `fly-through' of the ancient Nara Heijo-kyo capital of Japan, by combining aerially captured omnidirectional video augmented with related information using AR techniques~\cite{Okura2006,Okura2011}.

%=======

\textbf{***Video see through \& enhanced mobility by using a UMPC, this deserves better talking about in relation to Mirrorshades.}

video see-through head-mounted display~\cite{Rolland1994}

See-through video glasses, \textbf{***definition here, will be important later because MShades is see-through}, combined with an ultra mobile PC, have been used to render virtual humans as interfaces to virtual cultural heritage content including other real-time augmentations of 3D superimpositions of virtual content atop the view of the real, whilst allowing enhanced mobility compared to traditional approaches~\cite{Magnenat-Thalmann2008a}.

%=======

\textbf{***This needs talking about in relation to VTW, as it used different physical platforms each(?) with GPS \& compass readings.}

\textbf{***Is there any more later work about ARCHEOGUIDE? Seems like it would have spawned more work/publications.}

The ARCHEOGUIDE project (Augmented Reality-based Cultural Heritage On-site GUIDE) aimed to provide a `personalized electronic guide \& tour assistant' to cultural heritage site visitors. On-site help \& augmented reality reconstructions of on-site ruins were presented via a laptop, a tablet computer \& a PDA, using GPS for location tracking \& magnetometer to ascertain direction such that augmentations could be placed accordingly. The applications claimed to be supported by the platform range from archaeological research to education, multimedia publishing \& cultural tourism. The platform was prototyped at the archaeological site of Olympia, Greece~\cite{vlahakis:archeoguide}.

%=======

multi modal

The collaborative benefits of alternate reality technologies for archaeological excavations has been explored by VITA (Visual Interaction Tool for Archaeology), which allowed off-site visualisation of an archaeological dig site such that multiple users could collaborate whilst visualising the dig environment via a range of visual displays; a video see-through, head-tracked head mounted display, a projected table surface, a large screen display \& tracked hand-held displays. This provided new ways to organise, visualise \& combine the traditional 2D information associated with archaeological digs with 3D models of artefacts \& the site itself~\cite{benko:collaborative}.

%=======

2008

Real time animation \& illumination was used in a virtual reality restitution of the Roman theatre of Aspendos in Turkey, visualised as it was in the 3rd century, \& an on-site augmented reality simulation of a Thermopolium situated within Pompeii in Italy. Both included real time animated virtual humans, programmed to re-enact situations \& activities typical of their sites \& both actors \& the scenes themsevles were rendered using real time illumination strategies~\cite{Magnenat-Thalmann7}.

%=======

\textbf{*** On-site VR is not well represented, especially *mobile* on-site VR, the combination of mobility \& on-site is exclusively(?) employed by AR rather than VR}

%=======

\textbf{***See which came first, this or Magnenat-Thalmann7}

\textbf{2005 onwards}

The concept of real-time humans in AR sites was further investigated in the LIFEPLUS EU IST project, which aimed to produce ``an innovative 3D reconstruction of ancient frescos-paintings through the real-time revival of their fauna and flora, featuring groups of virtual animated characters with artificial life dramaturgical behaviors, in an immersive AR environment''. This project pushed established augmented reality applications to the field by exploring narrative design in fictional spaces, with the aim of increasing immersion via realistic interaction, making use of captured/real-time video of a real scene~\cite{Papagiannakis2004}, presenting the visitor with ``an immersive and innovative multi-sensory interactive trip to the past''~\cite{Papagiannakis2005}.

These realistic simulations of animated virtual human actors were employed in a mobile \& wearable setup, in abandonment of traditional concepts of static cultural artefacts or rigid augmentations of real world features, making use of a markerless camera tracker \& a PRT\textbf{(???)} mixed reality illumination model for more consistent real-virtual \& virtual-real rendering. This platform was demonstrated in a case study on the real site of ancient Pompeii. Whilst initially targetted at the cultural heritage sector, the author(s) clarifies that as a platform it in no way limited to use with such subjects~\cite{Papagiannakis2007}. The concept of extended rigid \& static AR with character-based event representations was pushed further by the author(s), with hopes of rereating not just discrete artefacts but the entirety of `daily life' in Pompeii~\cite{Papagiannakis2009}.

%=======

The use of omnidirectional range sensing for registration of real \& virtual content at cultural heritage sites has been explored, combining these close local shapes aquired from rangefinding with a landmark database of the large scale environment to achieve accurate registration for AR sightnseeing in historic sites~\cite{Taketomi2011}.

\textbf{***It seems that I don't really have many citations (in here at least, check Mendeley/folders) for *VR* being used in cultural heritage, but I have plenty for AR. Surely there must be lots more showing VR being used in CAVEs \& HMD (I'm thinking of one paper in particular that I don't think is cited here, has nice photos in)? I want to show that both AR \& VR have been applied to cultural heritage, but whereas AR maintains user mobility \& VR provides more atmospheric immersion, there haven't really been any attempts to combine the two \& allow users to be mobile in an atmospheric immersive VR counterpart to a real location.}

In particular, virtual reality has been used to allow people to immerse themselves in reconstructions of places that no longer exist \& augmented reality has been used to introduce pieces of the past atop a view of what remains in the real world today.

%=======

\textbf{***Does this actually mention any alternate reality stuff, or should I just use it as a citation for the importance of atmospheric immersion to experience virtual content in cultural heritage?}

\textbf{*** Major good quote for VR (\& thus PR) vs AR!!!}

deamicis:gamebased

Game based technology to enhance the learning of history and cultural heritage

Abstract only that talks about the use of game technologies to support learning of users
within cultural heritage sites. Says that the level of realism is ideal to visualise cultural
heritage if a string focus on the environment's atmosphere \& immersion is required, "emphasising
environmental effects such as fog, sky, water, particles", all of which self-proclaimed virtual
worlds aren't as good at.
        
Uses Unity3D! Mentions that it can produce web browser based applications as well as standalone
ones, has a simple authoring interface \& "exploits the latest graphical hardware by making extensive
use of shaders to deliver high quality graphics".

%=======

\textbf{***A lot of this is about virtual heritage in general \& would be good to open the section with, rather than trying to use it as a specifically VR citation.}

roussou:photorealism

Photorealism and Non-Photorealism
in Virtual Heritage Representation

The area of virtual heritage has long been concentrated on generating digital reconstructions of historical or
archaeological artefacts and sites with enough fidelity to be truly accurate representations of their real-world
counterparts. In some cases, the advancement of tools and techniques for achieving greater visual realism has
distracted from the development of other directions that enhance a virtual experience, such as interactivity, sound
or touch. Recent trends in the area of non-photorealistic rendering shift focus to the development of more “believable”
environments, while maintaining the accuracy and validity of the visualised data, which is significant for
archaeological research. In this paper we argue that it is important to enhance the perception of realism, achieved
both through photorealistic and non-photorealistic visualisation approaches, with interactivity. This is illustrated
by two example projects which develop prototype virtual environments created for specialists as well as novice
users.


        
"...virtual heritage has long been concentrated on generating digital reconstructions of historical or
archaeological artefacts and sites with enough fidelity to be truly accurate representations of their real
world counterparts."
        
Contrasts between photorealistic \& non-photorealistic computer graphics and that for some users the realism
isn't the most important factor, but rather how believeable \& convincing it is, regardless if the imagery
emulates the physical properties of the real world or not. More 'artistic' means of expression can that do
not necessarily hold true to a photographic view of a site can nonetheless be important to a user's understanding.
        
"In virtual heritage representation, architectural walkthroughs and picture-perfect simulations of objects
have defined a practice where photorealism is considered as perhaps the most important measure of a
successful representation."
        
But...
        
"...the emphasis on achieving a high degree of realism runs the risk of limiting VR reconstruction to the
creation of historically accurate yet static worlds that leave little flexibility for interpretive and/or
educational use."
        
So advanced realistic modelling techniques are good for accuracy \& authenticity, but non-photorealistic methods
can provide appropriate tools for more flexible uses in virtual heritage applications. This paper tries to
combine both photorealism \& interactivity into the same virtual reality framework under the CREATE project.
        
"...heritage is 'as much about the living and evolving place, people, and environment as it is about any
single static monument'"
        
"In the case of an archaeology scholar who intends to restore the ancient monument, the goal is to offer
the possibility to try varied reconstruction hypotheses and choose the most plausible."

Virtual Heritage : From the Research Lab to the Broad Public

The use of immersive Virtual Reality (
VR
) technology accounts almost a decade of research performed exclusively by the academic,military,and industrial research and development communities. However,as
VR
technologies mature,research is expanding from themilitary and scientific visualisation realm into more multidisciplinary areas,such as education,archeology,art,culture,and thehumanities. As representative institutions involved in the research and presentation of these fields,museums and cultural heritage centresmay be in a better position to make use of advanced virtual reality technologies and contribute to a broad-based public acceptance of technology as a tool for the study and presentation of the past. Nevertheless,the prohibitive costs and inaccessibility of immersive
VR
technologies,coupled with theoretical issues and issues of usability,user training,operation,and maintenance,continue to present  practical drawbacks,especially for the cultural and educational use of 
VR
. This paper explores some of these issues through examples of immersive virtual heritage applications for the broad public.

        
"The use of immersive VR technology accounts almost a decade of research" (as of publication in 2000)
        
"a tool for the study and presentation of the past"
        
"the visualization of abstract concepts and ideas, spaces that are unreachable or no longer exist, or objects
that must be examined from diverse and unique points of view"
        

        
"To virtualize heritage means to actualize it digitally, to simulate it using computer graphics technology..."
        
Lots more, etc.

cabral:x3dexperience

An experience using X3D for virtual cultural heritage

CAVE

In this paper we present our experience in using Virtual Reality
Technologies to accurately reconstruct and further explore ancient
and historic city buildings. Virtual reality techniques provide a
powerful set of tools to explore and access the history of a city.
In order to explore, visualize and hear such history, we divided the
process in three phases: historical data gathering and analysis; 3D
reconstruction and modeling; interactive immersive visualization,
auralization and display. The set of guidelines devised helped to
put into practice the extensible tools available in VR but not al-
ways easy to put together by inexperienced users. These guidelines
also helped the smoothness of our work and helped avoiding prob-
lems in the subsequent phases. Most importantly, the X3D standard
provided an environment capable of helping the design and vali-
dation process as well as the visualization phase. To finalize, we
present the results achieved and further analyze the extensibility of
the framework. Although VR tools and techniques are widely avail-
able at present, there is still a gap between using the tools and re-
ally taking advantage of VR in historic architectural reconstruction
so that users might immerse themselves into this world and thus be
able to consider various scenarios and possibilities that might lead
to new insightful inspiration. This is an ongoing process that we
think will increase and help current architectural development.

Leveraging a model of an ancient Greek templed in Messene created as part of the CREATE project, a system made use of a CAVE-like theatre, consisting of head-tracked user localization, a 2-armed haptic interface with realistic physics engine \& 3D sound, to host large scale visualizations of cultural heritage sites. Initial user studies into the usability \& performance of the system employed a simple task to ascertain the benefit (if any) of the haptic interface, while an additional qualitative study of the final system took place while it was installed in a museum~\cite{Christou2006}.

\textbf{***Useful quote for the shortcomings of self-proclaimed virtual worlds - "Such environments suffer
either from a lack of realism or a low degree of interactivity, due to technological and
methodological constraints.".}

Rendering of large and complex urban environments for real time heritage reconstructions

In this paper we describe a rendering package, which brings
together a number of rendering techniques and optimisations to
render large and complex urban environments at interactive frame
rates. The package has been built on top of a proprietary Scene
Graph structure developed for the CHARISMATIC project. The
paper presents an integrated approach combining Real-time
Optionally Adapting Meshes, View Frustum Culling, Occluder
Shadows, Level of Detail for Houses and Motion Captured
Avatars in a single application.

We discuss the performance issues associated with our
approaches and give comprehensive implementation details. We
also consider implications of the trends in high performance
graphics sub-systems for PCs in the context of data types and
animations required for populated interactive virtual heritage
experiences. Finally we present empirical results to demonstrate
the importance of employing such techniques and the implications
for practical virtual heritage applications.


Presents a rendering package with heavy focus on optimizations such as not rendering buildings
that are obscured by buildings in front of them, rendering buildings features like windows into
the wall textures so from a distance it looks as though the windows are there so they only need to
actually be rendered at closer range \& the difference is less noticeable.

Virtual Reality as Simulation: The CAVE as "Space of Illusion" in Museum Displays

But this chapter is not about virtual museums and cyberspace. It is rather concerned with the use of virtual reality (VR) within the very physical space of museums.

That form of interplay between physicality and digitality in museum displays, in order for something which is not physically present to be re-presented, creates a particular ``space of illusion'', which I will explore in the following pages.

%=========================================================================================================

AR has been used to add artefacts, actors \& reconstructed architecture to views of present day sites that bear traces of their original status, whilst VR has been used to host more complete reconstructions of entire buildings \& settlements for interaction via screen, HMD \& CAVE, including where the present day site bears no evidence of the past status or is inaccessible for some reason (due to latter development, change in landscape, etc.).

In situations where VR content exists in cultural heritage contexts, it is experienced from a static position that causes both spatial \& temporal separation from the RW location that it relates to; in order to perform comparisons between RW \& VR content, users must interact with one \& \textit{subsequently} the other. A mobile XR platform will allow VR content in cultural heritage contexts to be experienced in tandem with the real site (where accessible), combining the immediate juxtaposition of real \& virtual content of AR with the immersive \& atmospheric qualities of HMD based VR, all without requiring alterations to the VR content (for example to make it compatible with an AR framework).

\subsection{Digital Heritage at the University of St Andrews}

Motivation for this platform stemmed from a desire to leverage an existing virtual model of a 14th century cathedral in parallel with the present day ruins of the cathedral in the real world.

To build upon existing work within the Open Virtual Worlds research group, to allow our existing content to be accessed in a new \& exciting manner that also adds to its experience \& understanding.



The capacity of 3D environments to provide extensible collaborative platforms for the reconstruction of cultural heritage sites and the potential of such reconstructions to promote understanding of and engagement with cultural heritage content both in public and classroom settings has been demonstrated~\cite{Allison2012,Kennedy2012}. This research tested various deployment scenarios, leveraging different control methodologies (traditional keyboard and mouse, Xbox controllers and gesture recognition via Kinect) and display options (regular 24'' desktop monitors, larger 40'' televisions and still larger 150'' projection) along with voice interaction with actors playing the parts of historical figures. These scenarios support three deployment modes; a network of reconstructions accessible via the Internet as part of the OpenSim hypergrid; portable LAN exhibitions where multiple computers are connected to a server via local network suitable for classroom use; and immersive installations combining projection and Kinect for use in museums and cultural heritage centers. In all these scenarios a recurrent theme has been the relationship between the virtual reconstruction and the physicality of the corresponding physical site. Frequently projects have involved interactions with the reconstruction and subsequent visits and tours of the physical site; however the temporal separation between these activities makes it harder to appreciate the sometimes complex relationships between the two. To overcome this temporal separation of experiencing the virtual and the real it is necessary for the virtual representation to be accessible in tandem at the physical site by overcoming the vacancy problem.

The same pioneering collaborations between computer scientists, educationalists and historians that led to the creation of the St Andrews cathedral reconstruction have also led to the creation of reconstructions of; a 6th Century Spartan Basilica, Virtual Harlem (1921), Linlithgow Palace (1561), Brora Salt Pans (1599), Featherstone Fishing Station (19th century), Eyemouth Fort (1610), an Iron Age Wheel House and Caen Township (1815). These reconstructions provide a platform for interactive historical narratives, a stage for visitors to play upon and engage in both serious (and not so serious) games both alone and with other users, and serve as a focal point for educational investigations into local history and culture [9, 18]. The reconstructions have been widely used in a range of real world educational contexts. In the formal sector they have been a vehicle for investigative research, part of degree accredited university modules and used in both primary and secondary education. They have also been used as the content for interactive museum installations, art installations and community groups. This has involved further collaborations with Education Scotland, Historic Scotland, SCAPE Trust, Timespan cultural center, the Museum of the University of St Andrews (MUSA), Madras College, Linlithgow Palace and Strathkiness Primary School.

Widespread adoption of smartphones \& tablets in recent years has enabled people to multiplex their physical reality, where they engage in face-to-face social interaction, with Web-based social networks and apps\cite{Accenture2012}. Whilst such PolySocial situations are now commonplace with such 2D apps \& Web content, using smartphones \& tablets to multiplex real \& virtual environments in a parallel reality setting has not yet been attempted.

The suitability of smartphones \& tablets for location aware browsing of virtual content has been leveraged by AR apps, however their suitability for browsing a complete virtual environment parallel to the user's real location has not been thoroughly explored.
