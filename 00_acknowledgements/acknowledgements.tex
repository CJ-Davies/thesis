	\item My fellow research students, particularly the denizens of the venerable `Taint' chat; Ruth Hoffmann, Luke Hutton and Jonathan Ward.
	
	\item All of the staff at the School of Computer Science who made things that much more pleasant, academically or otherwise.
	
	\item The innumerable intellects around the world who, whether via mailing lists, Web forums, IRC channels, subreddits, blog comments or personal correspondence, have provided invaluable advice, assistance, input and inspiration on a truly bewildering range of (often seemingly unrelated) topics.
	
	\item The PhotoSoc committee and the Ents Crew for providing a life outwith the office.
	
	\item Tala Budziszewski for daring to proof read and for London-based respite.
	
	\item Ellen Shaw and Fiona Woodhall for caring so much.
