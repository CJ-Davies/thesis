Definition of virtual heritage - "Virtual heritage, broadly defined, involves the synthesis, conservation,
reproduction, representation, digital reprocessing, and display of cultural evidence with the use of
advanced imaging technology."
        
"...virtual heritage has long been concentrated on generating digital reconstructions of historical or
archaeological artefacts and sites with enough fidelity to be truly accurate representations of their real
world counterparts."
        
Contrasts between photorealistic \& non-photorealistic computer graphics and that for some users the realism
isn't the most important factor, but rather how believeable \& convincing it is, regardless if the imagery
emulates the physical properties of the real world or not. More 'artistic' means of expression can that do
not necessarily hold true to a photographic view of a site can nonetheless be important to a user's understanding.
        
"In virtual heritage representation, architectural walkthroughs and picture-perfect simulations of objects
have defined a practice where photorealism is considered as perhaps the most important measure of a
successful representation."
        
But...
        
"...the emphasis on achieving a high degree of realism runs the risk of limiting VR reconstruction to the
creation of historically accurate yet static worlds that leave little flexibility for interpretive and/or
educational use."
        
So advanced realistic modelling techniques are good for accuracy \& authenticity, but non-photorealistic methods
can provide appropriate tools for more flexible uses in virtual heritage applications. This paper tries to
combine both photorealism \& interactivity into the same virtual reality framework under the CREATE project.
        
"...heritage is 'as much about the living and evolving place, people, and environment as it is about any
single static monument'"
        
"In the case of an archaeology scholar who intends to restore the ancient monument, the goal is to offer
the possibility to try varied reconstruction hypotheses and choose the most plausible."

abstract = {Second Life (SL) is currently the most mature and popular multi-user virtual world platform being used in education. Through an in-depth examination of SL, this article explores its potential and the barriers that multi-user virtual environments present to educators wanting to use immersive 3-D spaces in their teaching. The context is set by tracing the history of virtual worlds back to earlymulti-user online computer gaming environments and describing the current trends in the development of 3-D immersive spaces. A typology for virtual worlds is developed and the key features that have made unstructured 3-D spaces so attractive to educators are described. The popularity in use of SL is examined through three critical components of the virtual environment experience: technical, immersive and social. From here, the paper discusses the affordances that SL offers for educational activities and the types of teaching approaches that are being explored by institutions. The work concludes with a critical analysis of the barriers to successful implementation of SL as an educational tool and maps a number of developments that are underway to address these issues across virtual worlds more broadly.},

Our approach considers design challenges for successfully developing and integrating pervasive technologies into culture and society. This is particularly challenging, since pervasive technologies as services are most successful when transparent, invisible, overlooked, unacknowledged and seemingly forgotten by the very groups that embrace their usage and development. We suggest a heuristic for understanding pervasive technology from an anthropological/social perspective, along with a reminder that humans create, shape and use the technologies that affect them. In particular, we look at the impact on social relations in a poly-social world where people must develop means to blend their own realities with those of of others. In conclusion, we remind those developing these technologies, that although we will eventually become wedded and intertwined as cyborgs within this new environment, it may have a positive outcome, creating new social group models for human interaction.},

Introduces the CHeR model, for creating, converting into digital form \& maintaining the
multitude of data related to cultural heritage sites. Observes that cultural heritage sites
often arouse little involvement in young people, particularly when presented with the ruins
of ancient settlements whose current appearance no longer reflects their original aspect and purpose.

@article{Milgram1994,
abstract = {This paper focuses on Mixed Reality (MR) visual displays, a particular subset of Virtual Reality (VR) related technologies that involve the merging of real and virtual worlds somewhere along the "virtuality continuum" which connects completely real environments to completely virtual ones. Probably the best known of these is Augmented Reality (AR), which refers to all cases in which the display of an otherwise real environment is augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects. The converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display environments are identified. However, an attempt to distinguish these classes on the basis of whether they are primarily video or computer graphics based, whether the real world is viewed directly or via some electronic display medium, whether the viewer is intended to feel part of the world or on the outside looking in, and whether or not the scale of the display is intended to map orthoscopically onto the real world leads to quite different groupings among the six identified classes, thereby demonstrating the need for an efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to which essential differences can be identified. The 'obvious' distinction between the terms "real" and "virtual" is shown to have a number of different aspects, depending on whether one is dealing with real or virtual objects, real or virtual images, and direct or non-direct viewing of these. An (approximately) three dimensional taxonomy is proposed, comprising the following dimensions: Extent of World Knowledge ("how much do we know about the world being displayed?"), Reproduction Fidelity ("how 'realistically' are we able to display it?"), and Extent of Presence Metaphor ("what is the extent of the illusion that the observer is present within that world?").},
annote = {Professor at University of Toronoto, responsible for coming up with the
virtuality continuum in all of its different versions. Provides some
fairly high-level theoretical discussion of what distinguishes the
different alternate realities that computer science has come to explore,
including how to determine whether an environment is augmented reality
or augmented virtuality (eg at what point does a scene stop being
augmented reality \& become augmented virtuality, etc.).
        
        
        
============
        
        
Brief introduction to mixed reality \& to the virtuality continuum
between completely real environments \& completely virtual environments.
        
Identifies 3 aspects that distinguish between real \& virtual;
> extent of world knowledge
	"how much do we know about the world being displayed?"
	world unmodelled (computer knows nothing about the contents of the
	environment) to world completely modelled (traditional virtual real-
	-ity where the computer has complete knowledge about each object in
	the environment)
> reproduction fidelity
	"how realistically are we able to display it?"
	pertains to both real \& virtual objects
> extent of prescence metaphor
	"what is the extent of the illusion that the observer is present
	within that world?"
	mixed reality displays include highly immersive environments with a
	strong presence metaphor, but also exocentric type AR displays
        
Identifies 6 different types of display technology that constitute mixed
reality interfaces.
        
Contains diagrams of virtuality continuum, extent of world knowledge,
reproduction fidelity \& extent of presence metaphor (all linear).

Indeed, for the past decade or more, personas (the designer-created profiles of end users) have become stand-ins for various usage cases and user models. With regard to location aware software and mobile applications, the usage of Dual Reality and Mixed Reality as metaphors have functioned in a similar vein. Just as personas are not people, Mixed and Dual Reality do not fully represent or address the complex usage cases developing as more people do more things, with more software at more times and in more spaces than ever before. This new complex application ecosystem presents greater opportunities and challenges for application design.

abstract = {More and more people dive into Virtual Worlds, experiencing the reality of parallel universes in almost every sector. Moreover, these virtual environments actually generate "real money" directly but also indirectly by selling virtual goods. Yet the current landscape consists in a huge number of siloed Virtual Worlds. We believe that addressing this lack of interoperability could greatly improve the user experience, ease the deployment of new worlds and open up market opportunities. Bell Labs' Applications domain is contributing with Virtual Hybrid Communications, a mature Web technology based on communication hyperlinks that enables the bridging of real and virtual worlds. This technology allows people to remain connected to legacy telecom infrastructures wherever they are (in real or virtual) and to safely expose their communication means without disclosing any personal detail (name, phone number, etc). Thanks to open and standard API, it will also allow virtual service providers and Telecom operators to provide efficient communication solutions and innovative services.},

abstract = {Nowadays, tourism has become a very important industry in the international economy. Information and communication technologies are in constant development; they progress worldwide and across sectors. Their applications in tourism and tourist resources is rapidly increasing, reaching new, innovative and sometimes amazing results in terms of effectiveness, productivity, quality, and customer satisfaction. Exploring the interaction between technologies and tourism is difficult and challenging. Specifically, using virtual world technologies as a new means of information for potential tourists is a big challenge where the actual methods, goals and needs still need to be exactly identified. This paper aims at analyzing why and how virtual worlds can become an important platform for tourism-oriented areas to promote a destination in general, and their local heritage and tourist added-value services in particular. The document will also introduce the design of the first prototypes and the validation results of the four specific technologies tested at the Virtual Travel Use Case (Soundscape generation, Multilinguality, Video streaming and Path and Camera Planning). Finally, the contribution to the MPEG-V standard will also be detailed in the paper.},

@article{Getchell2010,
abstract = {The construction and consolidation of knowledge through the practical application of concepts and processes can be difficult to support for subjects where practice is an integral component of competence and expertise in that domain. For example, participation in an archaeological excavation is not readily available to students, although a detailed understanding of what processes this involves is deemed to be core to the subject. The Laconia Acropolis Virtual Archaeology (LAVA) project has created a cooperative exploratory learning environment that addresses the need for students to engage with the complex practice of excavation. By leveraging the progressive nature of games methodologies and the immersive engagement provided by 3D multiuser virtual environments, LAVA facilitates the adoption of exploratory learning for excavation scenarios which have previously been inaccessible due to barriers of travel, time, and cost. A virtual environment based on real world data has been developed where groups of users are faced with a series of dynamic challenges with which they engage until such time that a certain level of competence is shown. Once a series of domain-specific objectives has been met, users are able to progress forward to the next level of the simulation. The excavation simulator enhances the student learning experience by providing opportunities for students to engage with the process in a customizable, virtual environment. Not only does this provide students with an opportunity to put the theories they are familiar with into practice, but it also allows students to gain experience in applying their skills in a bid to manage an excavation process, thereby making it possible for a greater emphasis to be placed on the practical application of knowledge that the excavation process necessitates. The potential of this approach has been confirmed by a positive user evaluation. LAVA contributes toward the progress of technology-enhanced learning by illustrating the- - instantiation of a framework which demonstrates how to integrate games methods with learning management systems and virtual worlds in order to support higher order learning behaviors such as applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating.},

abstract = {We have designed an active tagging system that responds to a coded optical beam from several meters away. The tags contain a minimalist microprocessor that ambiently operates in shutdown mode and, upon detecting particular frequency components in the AM-modulated interrogation beam, awakens to decode the incident digital message and produce an appropriate response. The lack of linear amplifiers means that these tags draw under 0.5 $\mu$A when sleeping, hence can operate up to 10 years on a lithium coin cell. Such devices are practical demonstrations of the potential of ubiquitous computing where common, nearly passive objects have a sense of identity and the ability to respond to external stimuli. In our example, the interrogator is a flashlight, with which one scans an area; when the light beam hits a tag programmed with a code that matches that sent by the interrogator, an on-tag LED flashes, indicating that the desired object is found.},

The number of persons with disabilities is large and increasing, as is their use of virtual worlds. All elements of virtual worlds must be accessible. Four types of real world disability impact functioning in virtual worlds: keyboard/mouse; print; hearing/speech; and cognitive. Some virtual worlds include accessibility features, such as resizable UI elements and fonts. Alternative keyboards and mice usually work adequately in virtual worlds. However, common text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and screen reader software doesn't interface well with virtual worlds. Existing accessibility guidelines and legislation (Universal Design, Internet accessibility standards and guidelines, and online game accessibility guidelines) might be applicable to virtual worlds. Practical limitations to implementation of these solutions include their complexity and cost. As government agencies, universities, and employers increase their use of virtual worlds, specific standards for virtual world accessibility, including interfacing with common assistive technology, need to be created and enforced.},

The standardized TEDS specified by IEEE 1451.2 allows the self-description of sensors and the interfaces provide a standardized mechanism to facilitate the “Plug and play ” of sensors to networks. The network-independent smart transducer object model defined by IEEE 1451.1 allows sensor manufacturers to support multiple networks and protocols. Thus, transducer-to-network interoperability is on the horizon. The inclusion of P1451.3 and P1451.4 to the family of 1451 standards will meet the needs of the analog transducer users for high-speed applications. In the long run, transducer vendors and users, system integrators, and network providers can all benefit from the IEEE 1451 interface standards},

abstract = {Simulation provides a range of educational tools that have increasingly been incorporated into emergency medicine (EM) curricula. Standardized patients and some partial task trainers, such as intubation heads, have been used for decades. More recently, a growing number of computer-screen simulations, high-fidelity mannequins, and virtual-reality simulators have expanded the number of procedures and conditions, which can be effectively simulated.The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education transitioned to a competency-based assessment of residency programs in 2001 and included simulation as a method for incorporating the 6 core competencies into graduate medical education curricula. Over the past decade, numerous peer-reviewed publications have promoted simulation as an effective educational tool for each of the core competencies.The advanced technology used to operate many current simulators can erroneously become the focus of efforts to create a simulation-based curriculum. Simulation can most effectively be incorporated into EM curricula through the use of time-proven concepts, which start with defining the targeted learners, assessing their general and specific educational needs, defining learning objectives, and selecting the best educational strategy for achieving each objective. In many, but not all, instances, simulation can be the best tool for achieving EM learning objectives.},

The hope is that we can avoid some of the complexities the Web has encountered by learning how to build applications and services before they are subject to the short-term necessities of commercial development. While Meru cannot compete with the content creation of commercial virtual worlds, it can, like the original World Wide Web at CERN, investigate basic questions about system design. By doing so, the door can be opened to a future where physical sensors in the real world seed their virtual reflections, users can visually browse a sea of information, and virtual avatars convey physical social cues to bring distance interaction to the level of actual presence.},

self proclaimed 'virtual worlds' like Second Life \& online games like

detail/bandwidth with which to render an object.
        
Envisages cross reality by a special 'space zero' within which physical
objects can register themselves \& thus advertise their presence \&
location to users of the virtual world. Nice example of a real person
walking down a street in the real world \& an avatar's position in space
zero being updated by GPS, with shop owners who have registered their
shops with space zero able to advertise specials to the avatar.
        
Also makes the point that, just like with the real web, it won't always
be actual users observing the virtual world, it may well be scripts/bots
that, for example, comb/search through specials.},

Currently these two are not capable of exchanging information, largely because of the lack of a global accepted standard for information exchange. Interaction between the real world and virtual worlds is mostly limited to classic mouse and keyboard devices, and exchange of information between different virtual worlds is virtually non-existent. We present a Use Case in the Metaverse1 project to increase motivation for continued physical exercising for the elderly by connecting real-world devices to virtual worlds, and allow information exchange through the teleportation of virtual objects from Second Life to our custom virtual biking world created in the Logos3D engine. We show that the principle of exchanging information between real and virtual worlds is simple, but the solution is non-trivial and requires not only a globally accepted standard to facilitate information exchange. From the results of a focus-group study, we show that a virtual environment does have the capability to increase motivation for exercising and that users do respond to a virtual exercise coach.},

When we discuss human group behavior, we refer to the definition of a social group: a collection of humans who repeatedly interact within a system. Humans can, and do switch context between environments and blend traces of one into the other in a socially unconscious manner often seemingly simultaneously. We propose that the cultures and behaviors of humans are increasingly actively permeating Internet and network- based applications, as well as those that are geolocal. With the future Internet of things, Dual Reality and Mixed Reality, the opportunity for humans to extend their own blended reality, as well as to create new ones is unfolding. That said, because humans interact within groups, the multiplexing of their mutual blended realities rapidly creates a PoSR. Sorting out the relationships between realities as well as between synchronous and asynchronous time and geolocal space can create a condition where realities are simultaneous and the idea of 'x' can be perceived as equaling 'not x.' We explore this new type of interoperability between virtual and physical, ideational and material, representations and objects and culture.},

abstract = {This paper presents a system architecture for creating interactive, multisensory, three-dimensional environments called virtual worlds. The architecture specifically addresses the requirements of virtual worlds for high performance, flexibility, and coordination of concurrent events. Performance is enhanced by a distributed client/server system structure and by efficient overlap of processing time and input/output delay. All processes communicate via asynchronous messages. The functional partitioning of a virtual world requires relatively low bandwidth among the individual processes and the system can be implemented over a conventional local-area network. A key element of this architecture is a central, event-driven dialogue manager which coordinates concurrent input and output events. The dialogue manager provides a clear separation of the interaction techniques from the content of the virtual world as defined by the application. The system is flexible and easily reconfigurable. An interaction technique can be readily changed or replaced because each interaction device is modularized into a separate server and each interaction modality into a separate subdialogue. Subdialogues can be loaded and dropped dynamically, enabling input/output device remapping and the selection of interaction techniques while a virtual world is running. As an initial test of this architecture we have implemented a virtual world for interacting with data from a computational fluid dynamics simulation.},

abstract = {There is evidence that animals utilize local anomalities of Earths magnetic field not just for orientation detection but also for true navigation, i.e. , some animals are not only able to detect the direction of Earths magnetic field (compass heading), they are able to derive positional information from local cues arising from the local anomalities of Earths magnetic field. Similarly to Earths non-constant magnetic field, the magnetic field inside buildings can be highly non-uniform. The magnetic field fluctuations inside buildings arise from both natural and man-made sources, such as steel and reinforced concrete structures, electric power systems, electric and electronic appliances, and industrial devices. Assuming the anomalities of the magnetic field inside a building are nearly static and they have sufficient local variability, the anomalies provide a unique magnetic fingerprint that can be utilized in global self-localization. Based on the evidence presented in this article it can be argued that this hypothesis is valid. In this article, a Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) technique based on the above hypothesis is proposed. The feasibility of the technique is demonstrated by presenting a series of global self-localization experiments conducted in four arbitrarily selected buildings, including a hospital. The experiment setup consists of a mobile robot instrumented with a 3-axis magnetometer and a computer. In addition to global robot self-localization experiments, successful person self-localization experiments were also conducted by using a wireless, wearable magnetometer. The reported experiments suggest that the ambient magnetic field may remain sufficiently stable for longer periods of time giving support for self-localization techniques utilizing the local deviations of the magnetic field.},

The calibrated sensor outputs were analyzed and validated with results obtained simultaneously from the Massachusetts General Hospital, Biomotion Laboratory. The GaitShoe proved highly capable of detecting heel-strike and toe-off, as well as estimating foot orientation and position, inter alia.},

Cited by Joshua Lifton in his PhD.
        
Technology Review is published by MIT, Wade Roush was staff at Technology Review for a number of years.
        
Another mention of Snow Crash's 'metaverse' \& allusions to it. Also mentions Gibson's notion of 'consensual hallucinations' in Neuromancer.
        
"Second Life is a true virtual world, unconstrained by any resemblance to the real planet." "These worlds are not games, however."
        
The term 'mirror worlds' was coined by Yale CS David Gelernter (Artificial Intelligence is Lost in the Woods, another Technology Review article).
        
Introduces the concept of 'mobile augmented reality'; accessing the data from extensive 3D simulations via 2D displays on location aware phones or whatnot.
        
Points out that Second Life \& Google Earth will probably endure as they are (with the usual upgrades) well into the metaverse era, rather than becoming the second earth concept embodied.
        
Lolworth quote - "...according to technology research firm Gartner, current trends suggest that 80 percent of active Internet users and FOrtune 500 companies will participate in Second Life or some competing virtual world by the end of 2011."
        
"As it turns out, simulations need not be convincing to be enveloping."
        
Mentions another vision of virtual earth; David Gelernter's 'Mirror Worlds: Or the day software puts the universe in a shoebox... how it will happen and what it will mean'.

Lifton's PhD thesis, essentially the inaugural piece of work on cross
reality. He called it 'dual reality' at this point but it's exactly the
same thing (which he confirms). Has probably the very first
definition of dual reality, definition of sensor networks/ubicomp/VWs,
identifies the bidirectional nature of cross reality, discusses mapping
between real \& virtual (whether it should be one-to-one or not), has a
survey of the earliest projects that did augmented virtuality, reference
to the 'second earth' concept, introduces the concept of 'virtual
sensing' which is a much better way to go about controlling actuation
from within the VW, identifies the platform-dependency of the Plug but
mentions that there is not much to stop it from being adapted to
different platforms, identifies that HTTP is pretty much the only means
of communicating with SL because XML-RPC is so useless, identifies the
lack of a standard middleware (with which to compare Plug etc. against),
mentions people maintaining an online presence, identifies that this
piece of work is 'framing dual reality as a new application domain for
sensor networks, virtual words \& media creation' \& identifies the
importance of automatic support to identify phenomena based on readings
from multiple sensed modalities.

abstract = {The growth in the range of disciplines that Virtual Worlds support for educational purposes is evidenced by recent applications in the fields of cultural heritage, humanitarian aid, space exploration, virtual laboratories in the physical sciences, archaeology, computer science and coastal geography. This growth is due in part to the flexibility of OpenSim, the open source virtual world platform which by adopting Second Life protocols and norms has created a de facto standard for open virtual worlds that is supported by a growing number of third party open source viewers. Yet while this diversity of use-cases is impressive and Virtual Worlds for open learning are highly popular with lecturers and learners alike immersive education remains an essentially niche activity. This paper identifies functional challenges in terms of Management, Network Infrastructure, the Immersive 3D Web and Programmability that must be addressed to enable the wider adoption of Open Virtual Worlds as a routine learning technology platform. We refer to specific use-cases based on OpenSim and abstract generic requirements which should be met to enable the growth in use of Open Virtual Worlds as a mainstream educational facility. A case study of a deployment to support a formal education curriculum and associated informal learning is used to illustrate key points.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) has often been linked to the sense of presence reported by users of those VEs. (Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability; there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs; individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and individuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.},

abstract = {We present experimental data on the limiting behavior of an interreality system comprising a virtual horizontally driven pendulum coupled to its real-world counterpart, where the interaction time scale is much shorter than the time scale of the dynamical system. We present experimental evidence that, if the physical parameters of the simplified virtual system match those of the real system within a certain tolerance, there is a transition from an uncorrelated dual reality state to a mixed reality state of the system in which the motion of the two pendula is highly correlated. The region in parameter space for stable solutions has an Arnold tongue structure for both the experimental data and a numerical simulation. As virtual systems better approximate real ones, even weak coupling in other interreality systems may produce sudden changes to mixed reality states.},

MIT's Media Laboratory (particularly the Responsive Environments group

the inaugural work in cross reality, with Joshua Lifton's PhD \& the
associated projects in the group framing 'dual reality', as it was
originally known, as a new application domain for sensor/actuator
networks, virtual worlds \& media creation. Lifton himself confirms that
cross reality \& dual reality are the same thing by different names.

Traditional media such as the telephone, radio, television, film, and many others offer a lesser degree of presence as well. This article examines the key concept of presence. It begins by noting practical and theoretical reasons for studying this concept. Six conceptualizations of presence found in a diverse set of literatures are identified and a detailed explication of the concept that incorporates these conceptualizations is presented. Existing research and speculation about the factors that encourage or discourage a sense of presence in media users as well as the physiological and psychological effects of presence are then outlined. Finally, suggestions concerning future systematic research about presence are presented.},

abstract = {Today's social virtual worlds (SVW) are beginning to realize Stephenson's vision of the metaverse: a future massive network of interconnected digital worlds. Tens of millions of people already use these kinds of environments to communicate, collaborate, and do business. Big companies are also moving into these digital realms. Thus, in a context in which the Web is becoming increasingly social, we believe that SVWs are beginning to shape the knowledge-based and glo balized societies and economies of tomorrow. Obviously, an urgent need exists to further understand SVWs and their implications for theory and practice. This article constitutes a first attempt to bring researchers into some of the business, social, technical, legal, and ethical issues related to SVWs. We anticipate that researchers will need to build new theories and concepts for SVWs, to explore the frontiers between reality and virtuality.},

abstract = {This paper proposes that virtual environments that aim to support mutual presence for distributed work groups should allow for multiple partial presence. The introduction of teleworking, and the massive uptake of mobile phones have addressed a need for people to be virtually present (if not physically present) from many spatial locations. Conventional virtual environment systems, however, seem fixed to a notion of presence as being tied to being in a specific place. It is this view of VR that we have modified with collaborative working in mind. Specifically, we have extended a graphical Internet-based 3D world to allow for users to have multiple, proxy, avatars which provides a sense of partial presence in many locations in the virtual world, and/or in many different virtual worlds. Presence is now not tied to place, but to awareness of events. Users are connected to their proxies by audio cues, allowing for multiple locations to be attended to at once, creating a form of presence appropriate to the workplace.},

In order to deal with the demand of locating static devices, the system is optimized for cheap implementation and on the other hand for a high resolution of locations.

to the disabled (eg by having no steps in virtual worlds, just ramps, so that if a disabled person

abstract = {Sentient computing systems, which can change their behaviour based on a model of the environment they construct using sensor data, may hold the key to managing tomorrow's device-rich mobile networks. At AT\&amp;amp;T Laboratories Cambridge, we have built a system that uses sensors to update a model of the real world. We designed the model's terms (object positions, descriptions and state, and so forth) to be immediately familiar to users. Thus, the model describes the world much as users themselves would. We can use this model to write programs that react to changes in the environment according to the user's preferences. We call this sentient computing because the applications appear to share the user's perception of the environment. Treating the current state of the environment as common ground between computers and users provides new ways of interacting with information systems. A sentient computing system doesn't need to be intelligent or capable of forming new concepts about the world, it only needs to act as though its perceptions duplicate the user's. In earlier work, we described a prototype of this system and stated our intention to deploy it on a large scale. We have now installed an enhanced version throughout an office building.

abstract = {Two studies investigated updating of self-position and heading during real, imagined, and simulated locomotion. Subjects were exposed to a two-segment path with a turn between segments; they responded by turning to face the origin as they would if they had walked the path and were at the end of the second segment. The conditions of pathway exposure included physical walking, imagined walking from a verbal description, watching another person walk, and experiencing optic flow that simulated walking, with or without a physical turn between the path segments. If subjects failed to update an internal representation of heading, but did encode the pathway trajectory, they should have overturned by the magnitude of the turn between the path segments. Such systematic overturning was found in the description and watching conditions, but not with physical walking. Simulated optic flow was not by itself sufficient to induce spatial updating that supported correct turn responses.},

abstract = {Abstract. St Andrews Cathedral is located on the East Coast of Scotland, construc- tion started in 1160 and spanned Romanesque and Gothic architectural styles. It was consecrated in 1318, four years after the battle of Bannockburn in the pres- ence of King Robert the Bruce. For several hundred years, the Cathedral was one of the most important religious buildings in Europe and the centre of religious life in Scotland. During the Scottish Reformation, John Knox lead reformers in divesting the Cathedral of much of its finery. Thereafter it fell into disuse and decline. Today the impressive remains only hint at the former glory of this important building. Cultural Heritage encompasses physical aspects such as architecture and arti- facts along with less tangible culture such as music, songs and stories. Open virtual worlds offer an extensible collaborative environment for developing historic scenes against the background of which material and ephemeral aspects of cultural her- itage associated with a site may be explored through engagement with historic nar- ratives. They offer the potential to reconstruct within a 3D computer environment both the physical structures of the past and important aspects of the light, music and life that once filled those structures. Virtual reconstructions enable scenarios to be created where individual pieces of art can be located and appreciated within the audio, visual and spacial contexts for which they were originally created. Bringing together architecture, sculpture, illumination, stained-glass, music, procession and lighting into a scene which can be explored from multiple spatial perspectives en- ables holistic experience and appreciation. Historic reconstructions may be created upon virtual stages allowing new and engaging Cultural Heritage perspectives to be accessible to diverse audiences. Through the example of St Andrews Cathedral reconstruction this paper presents an example of Open Virtual Worlds as a technology for supporting the creation and use of virtual reconstructions as a platform that promotes understanding of and engagement with Cultural Heritage. The use contexts discussed range from research based exploration of 3D spaces, to primary schools students using the reconstructions as a backdrop for tag. The digital literacies of the audience and goals of the use case impact on the appropriateness of the user interface. A range of interfaces are explored including games controllers, touch screens, tablets that provide location aware views into the model and hands free gesture control systems.},

We tried to create a partly-automatic system, which was aimed at producing a realistic model of the geometry and architectural style of the district, rather than an exact reconstruction of every detail. The residential buildings of the particular area follow some well defined architectural styles, which allows us to follow an automatic building generation, based on the 2D digital data and a library of predefined 3D building blocks. Starting from the GIS file, the data is sorted, examined and processed to detect the houses features and style as accurately as possible. The 3D model is then constructed by stitching together the appropriate blocks from the component library. Besides the automatic-generation method, we have used ImageModeler from RealViz to create accurate 3D representations of landmarks and exceptional buildings as well as for the building blocks.},

The first is a low-cost scanning laser rangefinder adapted to accurately track the position of bare hands in a plane just above a large projection display. The second is an acoustic system that detects the position of taps on a large, continuous surface (such as a table, wall, or window) by measuring the differential time-of-arrival of the acoustic shock impulse at several discrete locations. The third is a sensate carpet that uses a grid of piezoelectric wire to measure the dynamic location and pressure of footfalls. The fourth is a swept radio frequency (RF) tag reader that measures the height, approximate location, and other properties (orientation or a control variable like pressure) of objects containing passive, magnetically coupled resonant tags, and updates the continuous parameters of all tagged objects at 30 Hz. In addition to discussing the technologies and surveying different approaches, sample applications are given for each system.},

@article{VanderLand2011,
abstract = {In this paper, a theoretical model of effective team collaboration in 3D virtual environments is presented. The aim of this model is to enhance our understanding of the capabilities exerting influence on effective 3D virtual team collaboration. The model identifies a number of specific capabilities of 3D virtual worlds that can contribute to this team effectiveness. Compared to "traditional" computer-mediated collaboration technologies, 3D virtual environments support team collaboration primarily through (a) the shared virtual environment, and (b) avatar-based interaction. Through the shared virtual environment, users experience higher levels of presence (a feeling of actually "being there"), realism and interactivity. These capabilities increase the users' level of information processing. Avatar-based interaction induces greater feelings of social presence (being with others) and control over self-presentation (how one wants to be perceived by others), thus increasing the level of communication support in the 3D environment. Through greater levels of information and communication support, a higher level of shared understanding is reached, which in turn positively influences team performance. Our paper concludes by presenting several propositions which allow further empirical testing, implications for research and practice, and suggestions for future research. The insights obtained from this paper can help developers of these virtual worlds to design standards for the capabilities that influence effective team collaboration in 3D virtual environments.},

abstract = {Virtual worlds (VWs) are powerful three-dimensional technologies where users can assume identities and interact with others. While designed as open-platforms for creativity, expression, and experimentation by recreational users, VWs were once lauded for their potential applications to business. Today, much of the business community has either moved on from the hype of VWs or struggles to understand whether value can be obtained by using VWs. This paper attempts to provide an understanding of these outcomes through the analysis of assessments written by 59 business professionals, who each spent an extended period of time in a popular VW during the peak of the hype. From these assessments, four broad perspectives on the value of VWs to organizations (or lack thereof) were identified, along with challenges facing use of VWs if they are to become more widely used within business.},
