\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Content -} More in-depth explanation of contributions, identify future work (but don't dwindle).
	\item \textbf{What has been done -} Nothing.
	\item \textbf{What is left to do/how long should it take -} Should probably be written towards the end, after all design \& implementation, evaluation \& discussion has been completed. Should be a short section, 10 pages is probably far too long, shouldn't take long to write if the evaluation \& discussion section is done properly.

\section{PR Best Practices}

\begin{itemize}
	\item A 100\% RW view \& a 100\% VR view should be provided
	\item A method of transitioning between the two views at a user-controlled speed, with the ability to pause at any inbetween balance, should be provided
	\item A default view with \textless than 100\% RW should be provided, but should be toggleable \& not enforced
	\item This \textless 100\% should not be too much \textless 100\% because going too far hampers the overall experience
\end{itemize}
