\section{PR Best Practices}

\begin{itemize}
	\item A 100\% RW view \& a 100\% VR view should be provided
	\item A method of transitioning between the two views at a user-controlled speed, with the ability to pause at any inbetween balance, should be provided
	\item A default view with \textless than 100\% RW should be provided, but should be toggleable \& not enforced
	\item This \textless 100\% should not be too much \textless 100\% because going too far hampers the overall experience
\end{itemize}
