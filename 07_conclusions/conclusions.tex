\section{Contributions}

As listed in section \ref{intro-contributions} the contributions of this thesis can be summarized as follows;

\begin{itemize}
	\item The introduction of parallel reality as a new category of alternate reality that allows users to experience two complete environments in tandem \& represents an approach for mitigation of the vacancy problem.
	\item The framing of parallel reality through a thorough investigation \& extension of previous taxonomies that classify \& distinguish alternate reality terminologies.
	\item The creation of the combined Milgram/Waterworth model for visualising alternate reality experiences, including those of parallel reality systems.
	\item Development of a parallel reality platform, dubbed Mirrorshades, that combines new virtual reality hardware with novel indoor positioning technology.
	\item Evaluation of the Mirrorshades platform through user studies of a real world use case study within the realm of cultural heritage, including the application of an established presence questionnaire to parallel reality.
	\item Discussion \& creation of a set of best practices for future parallel reality endeavours.
\end{itemize}
