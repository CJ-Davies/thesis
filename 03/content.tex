\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Content -} Should lay out the theoretical motivations behind this work, outline the main issues that arise given these motivations \& describe the approaches taken to overcome the issues. For each part of this, pertinent related work should be overviewed (eg. this is where the literature review will be situated).
	\item \textbf{What has been done -} Extensive literature review was written at the end of year one. This literature review needs re-writing such that the pertinent parts are included in the relevant part of the discussion of `theory \& rationale' (eg the content of the literature review will be split up \& inserted where appropriate into the new `theory \& rationale' document). Literature read since the end of year one (which is substantial \& includes a slight shift in focus; presence, PoSR, older VR \& AR literature) needs incorporating.
	\item \textbf{What is left to do/how long should it take -} New document needs writing in the guise of 'theory \& rationale', splitting up \& inserting contents of old literature review \& writing in about more recently read literature since. 30 pages of the current literature review document is far too long, needs to be substantially cut down whilst covering more literature. Substantial exercise in writing/collating/drawing links between, etc. Might want to put aside a month or so of write-up time for this alone.
