Mirrorshades is a platform which allows a user to observe & move around their Real World (RW) enviornment whilst wearing a wide field of view (FOV), stereoscopic 3D, Head Mounted Display (HMD) which allows them to alternatively view a Virtual Reality (VR) representation of their current environment from the equivalent position & head orientation, without the need for any concious/manual control of their VR presence. This is achieved via the combination of an HMD, webcams, an indoor positioning system (IPS) & a 3D game engine.

The novel aspect of this mobile 'cross reality' platform, compared to prior augmented reality (AR) platforms, is that the user can observe two (or  more) discrete environments, each complete unto themselves, rather than observing a single environment comprised of their RW with virtual objects overlain. This allows the virtual aspect of the platform to be more immersive & is particularly suited to applications wherein it is desirable for the user to be immersed in virtual content rather than seeing some of it over their RW environment.

Measurable aspects;

1.) Accuracy of position & orientation (including lag)

2.) Performance of VR graphics

3.) Performance/fidelity of RW (camera) graphics

4.) Experience/worth of being able to switch - seems like the most important aspect, measure using some sort of presence questionnaire as a base?

Experiments;

1a.) Accuracy of IndoorAtlas in different RW environments & how (much) it relates to user experience (UX) - is there a measurable minimum level required?

1b.) What style of switching/blending between RW & VR feeds is best & what/is there a minimum fidelity for these feeds (particularly the RW feed as this will always be a drastic reduction from what the user is used to with just their normal eyesight)

2.) Take best accuracy environment & best switching/blending method & apply to cultural heritage scenario, get expert evaluation on how useful the concept is for their field
