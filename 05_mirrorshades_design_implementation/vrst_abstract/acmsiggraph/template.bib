Lifton's PhD thesis, essentially the inaugural piece of work on cross
reality. He called it 'dual reality' at this point but it's exactly the
same thing (which he confirms). Has probably the very first
definition of dual reality, definition of sensor networks/ubicomp/VWs,
identifies the bidirectional nature of cross reality, discusses mapping
between real \& virtual (whether it should be one-to-one or not), has a
survey of the earliest projects that did augmented virtuality, reference
to the 'second earth' concept, introduces the concept of 'virtual
sensing' which is a much better way to go about controlling actuation
from within the VW, identifies the platform-dependency of the Plug but
mentions that there is not much to stop it from being adapted to
different platforms, identifies that HTTP is pretty much the only means
of communicating with SL because XML-RPC is so useless, identifies the
lack of a standard middleware (with which to compare Plug etc. against),
mentions people maintaining an online presence, identifies that this
piece of work is 'framing dual reality as a new application domain for
sensor networks, virtual words \& media creation' \& identifies the
importance of automatic support to identify phenomena based on readings
from multiple sensed modalities.
