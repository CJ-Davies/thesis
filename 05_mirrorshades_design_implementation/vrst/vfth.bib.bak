  Abstract                 = {Sentient computing systems, which can change their behaviour based on a model of the environment they construct using sensor data, may hold the key to managing tomorrow's device-rich mobile networks. At AT\&amp;amp;T Laboratories Cambridge, we have built a system that uses sensors to update a model of the real world. We designed the model's terms (object positions, descriptions and state, and so forth) to be immediately familiar to users. Thus, the model describes the world much as users themselves would. We can use this model to write programs that react to changes in the environment according to the user's preferences. We call this sentient computing because the applications appear to share the user's perception of the environment. Treating the current state of the environment as common ground between computers and users provides new ways of interacting with information systems. A sentient computing system doesn't need to be intelligent or capable of forming new concepts about the world, it only needs to act as though its perceptions duplicate the user's. In earlier work, we described a prototype of this system and stated our intention to deploy it on a large scale. We have now installed an enhanced version throughout an office building. Over the past year, approximately 50 staff members have used the system daily with a set of trial applications},

  Abstract                 = {The growth in the range of disciplines that Virtual Worlds support for educational purposes is evidenced by recent applications in the fields of cultural heritage, humanitarian aid, space exploration, virtual laboratories in the physical sciences, archaeology, computer science and coastal geography. This growth is due in part to the flexibility of OpenSim, the open source virtual world platform which by adopting Second Life protocols and norms has created a de facto standard for open virtual worlds that is supported by a growing number of third party open source viewers. Yet while this diversity of use-cases is impressive and Virtual Worlds for open learning are highly popular with lecturers and learners alike immersive education remains an essentially niche activity. This paper identifies functional challenges in terms of Management, Network Infrastructure, the Immersive 3D Web and Programmability that must be addressed to enable the wider adoption of Open Virtual Worlds as a routine learning technology platform. We refer to specific use-cases based on OpenSim and abstract generic requirements which should be met to enable the growth in use of Open Virtual Worlds as a mainstream educational facility. A case study of a deployment to support a formal education curriculum and associated informal learning is used to illustrate key points.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a system architecture for creating interactive, multisensory, three-dimensional environments called virtual worlds. The architecture specifically addresses the requirements of virtual worlds for high performance, flexibility, and coordination of concurrent events. Performance is enhanced by a distributed client/server system structure and by efficient overlap of processing time and input/output delay. All processes communicate via asynchronous messages. The functional partitioning of a virtual world requires relatively low bandwidth among the individual processes and the system can be implemented over a conventional local-area network. A key element of this architecture is a central, event-driven dialogue manager which coordinates concurrent input and output events. The dialogue manager provides a clear separation of the interaction techniques from the content of the virtual world as defined by the application. The system is flexible and easily reconfigurable. An interaction technique can be readily changed or replaced because each interaction device is modularized into a separate server and each interaction modality into a separate subdialogue. Subdialogues can be loaded and dropped dynamically, enabling input/output device remapping and the selection of interaction techniques while a virtual world is running. As an initial test of this architecture we have implemented a virtual world for interacting with data from a computational fluid dynamics simulation.},

Indeed, for the past decade or more, personas (the designer-created profiles of end users) have become stand-ins for various usage cases and user models. With regard to location aware software and mobile applications, the usage of Dual Reality and Mixed Reality as metaphors have functioned in a similar vein. Just as personas are not people, Mixed and Dual Reality do not fully represent or address the complex usage cases developing as more people do more things, with more software at more times and in more spaces than ever before. This new complex application ecosystem presents greater opportunities and challenges for application design. We discuss ways that developers can use PolySocial Reality (PoSR) to represent a more complete complex structural model},

When we discuss human group behavior, we refer to the definition of a social group: a collection of humans who repeatedly interact within a system. Humans can, and do switch context between environments and blend traces of one into the other in a socially unconscious manner often seemingly simultaneously. We propose that the cultures and behaviors of humans are increasingly actively permeating Internet and network- based applications, as well as those that are geolocal. With the future Internet of things, Dual Reality and Mixed Reality, the opportunity for humans to extend their own blended reality, as well as to create new ones is unfolding. That said, because humans interact within groups, the multiplexing of their mutual blended realities rapidly creates a PoSR. Sorting out the relationships between realities as well as between synchronous and asynchronous time and geolocal space can create a condition where realities are simultaneous and the idea of 'x' can be perceived as equaling 'not x.' We explore this new type of interoperability between virtual and physical, ideational and material, representations and objects and culture.},

Our approach considers design challenges for successfully developing and integrating pervasive technologies into culture and society. This is particularly challenging, since pervasive technologies as services are most successful when transparent, invisible, overlooked, unacknowledged and seemingly forgotten by the very groups that embrace their usage and development. We suggest a heuristic for understanding pervasive technology from an anthropological/social perspective, along with a reminder that humans create, shape and use the technologies that affect them. In particular, we look at the impact on social relations in a poly-social world where people must develop means to blend their own realities with those of of others. In conclusion, we remind those developing these technologies, that although we will eventually become wedded and intertwined as cyborgs within this new environment, it may have a positive outcome, creating new social group models for human interaction.},

Because of this inherently interdisciplinary character, VR domain can be viewed as a melting pot of various technologies which although complementary are non-trivial to put together. Frameworks can be used to address this challenge as they offer advantages such as reusability of components, as well as easiness of replacements, extensions, and adaptations. Hence, this paper presents developments within the EPOCH project, in particular the Characterize NEWTON, to improve and release frameworks that support the incorporation of avatars in interactive real-time 3D VR systems. The purpose is to enable avatars to be interactive and to react to model metadata; thus adding realism and engaging the users interest. This vertical middleware offers the advantage to be based on open source generic frameworks, such as OpenScenegraph and OpenSG as well as offering complementary functionalities},

The "GaitShoe" was built to be worn in any shoe, without interfering with gait and was designed to collect data unobtrusively, in any environment, and over long periods. The calibrated sensor outputs were analyzed and validated with results obtained simultaneously from the Massachusetts General Hospital, Biomotion Laboratory. The GaitShoe proved highly capable of detecting heel-strike and toe-off, as well as estimating foot orientation and position, inter alia.},

It covers everything from MUDs to MOOs to MMORPGs, from text-based to graphical VWs.Designing Virtual Worlds brings a rich, well-developed approach to the designconcepts behind virtual worlds. It is grounded in the earliest approaches to such designs, but the examples discussed in the book run the gamut from the earliest MUDs to the present-day MMORPG games mentioned above. It teaches the reader the actual, underlying design principles that many designers do not understand when they borrow or build from previous games. There is no other design book on the market in the area of online games and virtual worlds that provides the rich detail, historical context, and conceptual depth ofDesigning Virtual Worlds.},

While designed as open-platforms for creativity, expression, and experimentation by recreational users, VWs were once lauded for their potential applications to business. Today, much of the business community has either moved on from the hype of VWs or struggles to understand whether value can be obtained by using VWs. This paper attempts to provide an understanding of these outcomes through the analysis of assessments written by 59 business professionals, who each spent an extended period of time in a popular VW during the peak of the hype. From these assessments, four broad perspectives on the value of VWs to organizations (or lack thereof) were identified, along with challenges facing use of VWs if they are to become more widely used within business.},

We focus on augmenting existing archaeological analysis methods with new ways to organize, visualize, and combine the standard 2D information available from an excavation (drawings, pictures, and notes) with textured, laser range-scanned 3D models of objects and the site itself. Users can combine speech, touch, and 3D hand gestures to interact multimodally with the environment. Preliminary user tests were conducted with archaeology researchers and students, and their feedback is presented here.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies showed that neurons in the monkey premotor cortex became active when performing a particular action and also when observing the same action performed by others. These findings suggest a mirror system for action observation. Recently, bimodal neurons, sensitive both to visual and tactile stimulation, were reported in the parietal cortex, suggesting a potential mirror neuron system for observing and experiencing tactile stimulation. Subsequently, a mirror neuron system for observed touch has been suggested. The current study was designed to determine whether the activation of a sensory mirror system during touch observation is affected by possible attributions of the observed touch to oneself (subjective view) or to somebody else (objective view). In the study, healthy volunteers observed video clips of a touched or nontouched hand either in an egocentric or in an allocentric perspective during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results showed activation of somatosensory cortices when observing the hand being touched in egocentric as well as in the allocentric perspectives. Moreover, somatosensory responses differed depending on the perspective of the observed touch. We discuss the results in terms of a possible mirror neuron system for observed and experienced touch.},

  Abstract                 = {Nowadays, tourism has become a very important industry in the international economy. Information and communication technologies are in constant development; they progress worldwide and across sectors. Their applications in tourism and tourist resources is rapidly increasing, reaching new, innovative and sometimes amazing results in terms of effectiveness, productivity, quality, and customer satisfaction. Exploring the interaction between technologies and tourism is difficult and challenging. Specifically, using virtual world technologies as a new means of information for potential tourists is a big challenge where the actual methods, goals and needs still need to be exactly identified. This paper aims at analyzing why and how virtual worlds can become an important platform for tourism-oriented areas to promote a destination in general, and their local heritage and tourist added-value services in particular. The document will also introduce the design of the first prototypes and the validation results of the four specific technologies tested at the Virtual Travel Use Case (Soundscape generation, Multilinguality, Video streaming and Path and Camera Planning). Finally, the contribution to the MPEG-V standard will also be detailed in the paper.},

In this age of interactive media, self-cocept creation further requires an awareness of control of disclosure. The more one discloses personal information, the more others will reciprocate, and teh more individuals know about each other the more likely they are to establish trust, seek support, and thus find satisfaction. Without disclosure and interaction nothing happens. Disclosure creates a kind of currency that is spent to keep interaction moving" (p. 4) "Regarding the formation of self-concept, control of information disclosure is important for the interaction of individuals as they seek to form affiliations and trusting relationships" "Personal information helps form relationships by disclosing interntions and thus building trust" (p. 6) Commitment "Committment does not come out of previous relationships but out of the temporal mutuality of interests" (p. 7) "Commitment of participants seems to be to maintaining their opportunities to continue discussions and to maintaining social decorum" (p,. 7) "Further commitment to maintain groups can be found in the discourses tangent to discussion or issues. Participants argue, cajole, rebuke, rejoin, rally to support each other and seek to reconcile warring parties" (p. 10) Management "People change the information space they work in" (p. 8) Social Presence The concept of social presence has already a literature allied to that of CMC. Short, Williams, and Christie (1976) take the ability of a medium to deliver degrees of audio and visual richness and tie it to a perceiver's subjective awareness of another communicator. However in cyberspace social presence in interactive social spaces takes on more of a complexion of reciprocal awareness by others of an individual and the individual's awareness of others. In interactive media such as CMC an new, mutual sense of interaction is essential to the feeling that others are there. Lurkers have low social presence, flaming reveals high social presence.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A virtual reality (VR) system tracks one or more objects to generate the depiction of a virtual environment from the user's vantage point. No system achieves this instantaneously: changes in the depicted virtual environment are delayed from changes in the position of the objects being tracked. In this paper, a method is proposed to quantify this time difference, the end-to-end delay of the VR system. Two light-sensing devices and two luminance gradients are used to simultaneously encode the position of one tracked object and its virtual counterpart. One light-sensing device is attached to the tracked object and it captures light from the gradient in the physical environment. The other device captures light from the gradient in the virtual environment. A measurement is obtained by moving the tracked object repetitively (by hand) across the gradient. The end-to-end delay is the asynchrony between the signals generated by the two light-sensing devices. The results collected with oscillatory movements performed at different frequencies indicate that for some VR systems, the end-to-end delay might not be constant but could vary as a function of the oscillation frequency.},

We tried to create a partly-automatic system, which was aimed at producing a realistic model of the geometry and architectural style of the district, rather than an exact reconstruction of every detail. The residential buildings of the particular area follow some well defined architectural styles, which allows us to follow an automatic building generation, based on the 2D digital data and a library of predefined 3D building blocks. Starting from the GIS file, the data is sorted, examined and processed to detect the housesÂ’ features and style as accurately as possible. The 3D model is then constructed by stitching together the appropriate blocks from the component library. Besides the automatic-generation method, we have used ImageModeler from RealViz to create accurate 3D representations of landmarks and exceptional buildings as well as for the building blocks.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a simple and robust Mixed Reality (MR) framework that allows for real-time interaction with Virtual Humans in real and virtual environments under consistent illumination. We will look at three crucial parts of this system: interaction, animation and global illumination of virtual humans for an integrated and enhanced presence. The interaction system comprises of a dialogue module, which is interfaced with a speech recognition and synthesis system. Next to speech output, the dialogue system generates face and body motions, which are in turn managed by the virtual human animation layer. Our fast animation engine can handle various types of motions, such as normal key-frame animations, or motions that are generated on-the-fly by adapting previously recorded clips. All these different motions are generated and blended on-line, resulting in a flexible and realistic animation. Our robust rendering method operates in accordance with the previous animation layer, based on an extended for virtual humans Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) illumination model, resulting in a realistic display of such interactive virtual characters in mixed reality environ- ments. Finally, we present a scenario that illustrates the interplay and application of our methods, glued under a unique framework for presence and interaction in MR.},

The goal of this article is to describe the techniques used in order to achieve a real time rendering and animation of the selected space and its characters, as well as to point out the challenges and solutions that such a work implies at different stages in production. Most of these issues are focused on the reconstruction of the architecture of the site; however, in order to achieve an accurate simulation, the social aspect is not to be omitted. The importance of a heritage site resides as well in the historical characters and the social interactions that were taking place there: this information allows a better understanding of the function and the importance of the selected site in connection with the cultural aspects of the life at a certain time. In order to strengthen the feeling of immersion in a heritage edifice virtually restituted, it is important to recreate virtual life and describe the timely evolutionary aspects of the edifice as well.}

This creates an interesting audiovisual experience for the user, playing upon the poetic narrative of combining cardio-centric metaphors pervasive in everyday life (the heart as a symbol of love and centrality, e.g. "get to the heart of the matter") with ubiquitous occular-centric metaphors such as "see the world from my point of view". This audiovisual experience is further enhanced by combining music which alters the visual perception and also heightens the user's emotional response to their experience and, in doing so, further affects their heart(beat).},

  Abstract                 = {In this issue, we report on the first phase of MPEG-V, a work that started in 2007. MPEG-V was conceived as a unified effort to develop standards within virtual worlds, and between virtual worlds and real worlds. This work culminated in the publication of the ISO/IEC MPEG-V 'Media context and control' standards in January 2011. The papers in this issue of the Journal of Virtual World Research expose both the many current standards for virtual worlds, as well as the many missing standards. As such, the issue hints at many more places where standards are needed. To fulfill the potential of virtual worlds much more standardization (MPEG-V, and other standards) is needed.},

A group of about 30 EU-based organizations totalling about 100 people worked together from 2008 to 2011 to develop a global standard that will connect virtual worlds and real worlds. The project, which was under the Eureka/ITEA2 framework, was one of the key contributors to the MPEG-V 'Media context and control' standard published by ISO/IEC in January 2011. The review includes the need for virtual worlds stadnards, the formation of the research team and plan, internal research results, main outcome (MPEG-V standard). We will conclude with some reflective notes. The ITEA2 Metaverse1 project has developed a standardized global framework enabling interoperability between virtual worlds such as Second Life, IMVU, OpenSim, Active Worlds, Google Earth and with the real world in terms of sensors and actuators, vision and rendering systems, and applications in areas like social and welfare systems, banking, insurance, tourism and real estate. Results of the project drove the MPEG-V 'Media context and control' standard published by ISO/IEC in January 2011.},

  Abstract                 = {The construction and consolidation of knowledge through the practical application of concepts and processes can be difficult to support for subjects where practice is an integral component of competence and expertise in that domain. For example, participation in an archaeological excavation is not readily available to students, although a detailed understanding of what processes this involves is deemed to be core to the subject. The Laconia Acropolis Virtual Archaeology (LAVA) project has created a cooperative exploratory learning environment that addresses the need for students to engage with the complex practice of excavation. By leveraging the progressive nature of games methodologies and the immersive engagement provided by 3D multiuser virtual environments, LAVA facilitates the adoption of exploratory learning for excavation scenarios which have previously been inaccessible due to barriers of travel, time, and cost. A virtual environment based on real world data has been developed where groups of users are faced with a series of dynamic challenges with which they engage until such time that a certain level of competence is shown. Once a series of domain-specific objectives has been met, users are able to progress forward to the next level of the simulation. The excavation simulator enhances the student learning experience by providing opportunities for students to engage with the process in a customizable, virtual environment. Not only does this provide students with an opportunity to put the theories they are familiar with into practice, but it also allows students to gain experience in applying their skills in a bid to manage an excavation process, thereby making it possible for a greater emphasis to be placed on the practical application of knowledge that the excavation process necessitates. The potential of this approach has been confirmed by a positive user evaluation. LAVA contributes toward the progress of technology-enhanced learning by illustrating the- - instantiation of a framework which demonstrates how to integrate games methods with learning management systems and virtual worlds in order to support higher order learning behaviors such as applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating.},

The region in parameter space for stable solutions has an Arnold tongue structure for both the experimental data and a numerical simulation.

Personal networks (PNs) are designed to meet the users' needs and interconnect users' devices equipped with different communications technologies in various places to form one network. Location-aware services need to be developed in PNs to offer flexible and adaptive personal services and improve the quality of lives. This paper gives a comprehensive survey of numerous IPSs, which include both commercial products and research-oriented solutions. Evaluation criteria are proposed for assessing these systems, namely security and privacy, cost, performance, robustness, complexity, user preferences, commercial availability, and limitations.We compare the existing IPSs and outline the trade-offs among these systems from the viewpoint of a user in a PN.},

Similarly to Earths non-constant magnetic field, the magnetic field inside buildings can be highly non-uniform. The magnetic field fluctuations inside buildings arise from both natural and man-made sources, such as steel and reinforced concrete structures, electric power systems, electric and electronic appliances, and industrial devices. Assuming the anomalities of the magnetic field inside a building are nearly static and they have sufficient local variability, the anomalies provide a unique magnetic fingerprint that can be utilized in global self-localization. Based on the evidence presented in this article it can be argued that this hypothesis is valid. In this article, a Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) technique based on the above hypothesis is proposed. The feasibility of the technique is demonstrated by presenting a series of global self-localization experiments conducted in four arbitrarily selected buildings, including a hospital. The experiment setup consists of a mobile robot instrumented with a 3-axis magnetometer and a computer. In addition to global robot self-localization experiments, successful person self-localization experiments were also conducted by using a wireless, wearable magnetometer.

  Abstract                 = {I have lived in San Francisco while working as a full-time virtual faculty member for Michigan State University for nearly six years. Unlike most humans, I spend a larger proportion of every day as a virtual person than as a physical person. This article is adapted from a keynote speech I delivered at the Fourth International Workshop on Presence in Philadelphia in May of 2001. I use a personal narrative style to explore issues and to question some of the research community's prevailing assumptions about presence. Lombard and Ditton's (1997) frequently cited conceptualization defines presence as a â€œperceptual illusion of nonmediationâ€? that occurs â€œwhen a person fails to perceive or acknowledge the existence of a medium in his/her communication environment and responds as he/she would if the medium were not there.â€? The underlying assumption is that, in the absence of technology, everyone experiences continuous presence at a constant intensity throughout their lives. Instead, this article suggests that presence is not a constant of everyday nonmediated experience.

Thus, in a context in which the Web is becoming increasingly social, we believe that SVWs are beginning to shape the knowledge-based and glo balized societies and economies of tomorrow. Obviously, an urgent need exists to further understand SVWs and their implications for theory and practice. This article constitutes a first attempt to bring researchers into some of the business, social, technical, legal, and ethical issues related to SVWs. We anticipate that researchers will need to build new theories and concepts for SVWs, to explore the frontiers between reality and virtuality.},

The hope is that we can avoid some of the complexities the Web has encountered by learning how to build applications and services before they are subject to the short-term necessities of commercial development. While Meru cannot compete with the content creation of commercial virtual worlds, it can, like the original World Wide Web at CERN, investigate basic questions about system design. By doing so, the door can be opened to a future where physical sensors in the real world seed their virtual reflections, users can visually browse a sea of information, and virtual avatars convey physical social cues to bring distance interaction to the level of actual presence.},

self proclaimed 'virtual worlds' like Second Life \& online games like
WoW \& Eve Online). Proposes the Meru Project (Stanford) as a virtual
world architecture that can scale to global scales by modelling the
virtual world after the real world - eg using distance to determine the
detail/bandwidth with which to render an object.
 
Envisages cross reality by a special 'space zero' within which physical
objects can register themselves \& thus advertise their presence \&
location to users of the virtual world. Nice example of a real person
walking down a street in the real world \& an avatar's position in space
zero being updated by GPS, with shop owners who have registered their
shops with space zero able to advertise specials to the avatar.
 
Also makes the point that, just like with the real web, it won't always
be actual users observing the virtual world, it may well be scripts/bots
that, for example, comb/search through specials.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study investigates the subjective feeling of presence elicited by 3DTV and its relationship to perceived depth and image content. Subjective methods of assessing presence that have been used or proposed to date do not provide a measure of temporal variation. To overcome this limitation, we have applied the continuous assessment methodology (ITU-R, BT 500-7) to the assessment of presence, perceived depth and naturalness of depth. Twelve observers continuously rated their instantaneous perception of presence, depth and naturalness of depth when viewing stereoscopic footage. The results indicate that subjective presence ratings are subject to considerable temporal variation depending on the image content and camera techniques used. The correlations between the different attributes suggest that an increase in depth may lead to an enhanced sense of presence, provided depth is perceived as natural. A qualitative analysis of the data in relation to the image content provides evidence for the hypothesis that the extent of sensory information available to an observer is a determinant of presence, as proposed by T.B.

But how do we determine the extent to which a user feels present in the virtual environment? This chapter examines three categories of methods commonly used for measuring presence; their use in the field, advantages, and disadvantages. Subjective measures rely on self-assessment by the user. Users answer questions such as "How real did the environment seem to you?", "Was the environment like a place you visited, or a series of images presented to you?". Behavioral measures examine actions or manners exhibited by the user that are responses to objects or events in the virtual environment. For example, does the user duck if a virtual object is thrown at his head. Physiological methods attempt to measure presence by gauging changes in the subject's heart rate, skin temperature, skin conductance, breathing rate, etc. In a stress-inducing virtual environment does the user exhibit physiological signs of stress? How do these methods compare when using the criteria of reliability, validity, objectivity, and sensitivity.},

The introduction of teleworking, and the massive uptake of mobile phones have addressed a need for people to be virtually present (if not physically present) from many spatial locations. Conventional virtual environment systems, however, seem fixed to a notion of presence as being tied to being in a specific place. It is this view of VR that we have modified with collaborative working in mind. Specifically, we have extended a graphical Internet-based 3D world to allow for users to have multiple, proxy, avatars which provides a sense of partial presence in many locations in the virtual world, and/or in many different virtual worlds. Presence is now not tied to place, but to awareness of events. Users are connected to their proxies by audio cues, allowing for multiple locations to be attended to at once, creating a form of presence appropriate to the workplace.},

The inclusion of P1451.3 and P1451.4 to the family of 1451 standards will meet the needs of the analog transducer users for high-speed applications.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract. St Andrews Cathedral is located on the East Coast of Scotland, construc- tion started in 1160 and spanned Romanesque and Gothic architectural styles. It was consecrated in 1318, four years after the battle of Bannockburn in the pres- ence of King Robert the Bruce. For several hundred years, the Cathedral was one of the most important religious buildings in Europe and the centre of religious life in Scotland. During the Scottish Reformation, John Knox lead reformers in divesting the Cathedral of much of its finery. Thereafter it fell into disuse and decline. Today the impressive remains only hint at the former glory of this important building. Cultural Heritage encompasses physical aspects such as architecture and arti- facts along with less tangible culture such as music, songs and stories. Open virtual worlds offer an extensible collaborative environment for developing historic scenes against the background of which material and ephemeral aspects of cultural her- itage associated with a site may be explored through engagement with historic nar- ratives. They offer the potential to reconstruct within a 3D computer environment both the physical structures of the past and important aspects of the light, music and life that once filled those structures. Virtual reconstructions enable scenarios to be created where individual pieces of art can be located and appreciated within the audio, visual and spacial contexts for which they were originally created. Bringing together architecture, sculpture, illumination, stained-glass, music, procession and lighting into a scene which can be explored from multiple spatial perspectives en- ables holistic experience and appreciation. Historic reconstructions may be created upon virtual stages allowing new and engaging Cultural Heritage perspectives to be accessible to diverse audiences. Through the example of St Andrews Cathedral reconstruction this paper presents an example of Open Virtual Worlds as a technology for supporting the creation and use of virtual reconstructions as a platform that promotes understanding of and engagement with Cultural Heritage. The use contexts discussed range from research based exploration of 3D spaces, to primary schools students using the reconstructions as a backdrop for tag. The digital literacies of the audience and goals of the use case impact on the appropriateness of the user interface. A range of interfaces are explored including games controllers, touch screens, tablets that provide location aware views into the model and hands free gesture control systems.},

Second Life is the heterogeneity of the hardware \& thus a Ubiquitous
Sensor Middleware (USN) is needed. Presents such a USN, COSMOS, which
integrates with RFID reader networks, sensor \& actuator network \& shows
how it functions as part of a cross reality system. COSMOS is tested
using software simulations of hardware.

The conditions of pathway exposure included physical walking, imagined walking from a verbal description, watching another person walk, and experiencing optic flow that simulated walking, with or without a physical turn between the path segments. If subjects failed to update an internal representation of heading, but did encode the pathway trajectory, they should have overturned by the magnitude of the turn between the path segments. Such systematic overturning was found in the description and watching conditions, but not with physical walking. Simulated optic flow was not by itself sufficient to induce spatial updating that supported correct turn responses.},

The purpose of this research project is to develop and examine a new simulation platform that is designed from the ground up for handhelds to create augmented reality simulations (i.e. simulations that bridge virtual and real worlds). This paper describes environmental detectives, one such augmented reality simulation that is currently being developed at MIT.

A slightly strange article, talks about the importance of designing virtual worlds to be accessible
to the disabled (eg by having no steps in virtual worlds, just ramps, so that if a disabled person
represents themselves in the virtual world by an avatar restricted to a wheel chair they will still
be able to move around). Essentially an emphasis that virtual world locations should represent their
real ones accurately when it comes to access, tangentially related to the mimicing of a real world
location with a virtual environment simulation a la cross reality.

  Abstract                 = {Accessibility is an important area of interoperability between real and virtual worlds that must be considered during standards-setting. The number of persons with disabilities is large and increasing, as is their use of virtual worlds. All elements of virtual worlds must be accessible. Four types of real world disability impact functioning in virtual worlds: keyboard/mouse; print; hearing/speech; and cognitive. Some virtual worlds include accessibility features, such as resizable UI elements and fonts. Alternative keyboards and mice usually work adequately in virtual worlds. However, common text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and screen reader software doesn't interface well with virtual worlds. Existing accessibility guidelines and legislation (Universal Design, Internet accessibility standards and guidelines, and online game accessibility guidelines) might be applicable to virtual worlds. Practical limitations to implementation of these solutions include their complexity and cost. As government agencies, universities, and employers increase their use of virtual worlds, specific standards for virtual world accessibility, including interfacing with common assistive technology, need to be created and enforced.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a theoretical model of effective team collaboration in 3D virtual environments is presented. The aim of this model is to enhance our understanding of the capabilities exerting influence on effective 3D virtual team collaboration. The model identifies a number of specific capabilities of 3D virtual worlds that can contribute to this team effectiveness. Compared to "traditional" computer-mediated collaboration technologies, 3D virtual environments support team collaboration primarily through (a) the shared virtual environment, and (b) avatar-based interaction. Through the shared virtual environment, users experience higher levels of presence (a feeling of actually "being there"), realism and interactivity. These capabilities increase the users' level of information processing. Avatar-based interaction induces greater feelings of social presence (being with others) and control over self-presentation (how one wants to be perceived by others), thus increasing the level of communication support in the 3D environment. Through greater levels of information and communication support, a higher level of shared understanding is reached, which in turn positively influences team performance. Our paper concludes by presenting several propositions which allow further empirical testing, implications for research and practice, and suggestions for future research. The insights obtained from this paper can help developers of these virtual worlds to design standards for the capabilities that influence effective team collaboration in 3D virtual environments.},

The ITC-Sense of Presence Inventory (ITC-SOPI) is a new state questionnaire measure whose development has been informed by previous research on the determinants of precence and current self-report measures. It focuses on usersâ€™ experiences of media, with no reference to objective system parameters. More than 600 people completed the ITC-SOPI following an experience with one of a range of noninteractive and interactive media. Exploratory analysis (principal axis factoring) revealed four factors: Sense of Physical Space, Engagement, Ecological Validity, and Negative Effects. Relations between the factors and the consistency of the factor structure with others reported in the literature are discussed. Preliminary analyses described here demonstrate that the ITC-SOPI is reliable and valid, but more rigorous testing of its psychometric properties and applicability to interactive virtual environments is required. Subject to satisfactory confirmatory analyses, the ITC-SOPI will offer researchers using a range of media systems a tool with which to measure four facets of a media experience that are putatively related to presence.},

Lifton's PhD thesis, essentially the inaugural piece of work on cross
reality. He called it 'dual reality' at this point but it's exactly the
same thing (which he confirms). Has probably the very first
definition of dual reality, definition of sensor networks/ubicomp/VWs,
identifies the bidirectional nature of cross reality, discusses mapping
between real \& virtual (whether it should be one-to-one or not), has a
survey of the earliest projects that did augmented virtuality, reference
to the 'second earth' concept, introduces the concept of 'virtual
sensing' which is a much better way to go about controlling actuation
from within the VW, identifies the platform-dependency of the Plug but
mentions that there is not much to stop it from being adapted to
different platforms, identifies that HTTP is pretty much the only means
of communicating with SL because XML-RPC is so useless, identifies the
lack of a standard middleware (with which to compare Plug etc. against),
mentions people maintaining an online presence, identifies that this
piece of work is 'framing dual reality as a new application domain for
sensor networks, virtual words \& media creation' \& identifies the
importance of automatic support to identify phenomena based on readings
from multiple sensed modalities.

Three typical location estimation schemes of triangulation, scene analysis, and proximity are analyzed. We also discuss location fingerprinting in detail since it is used in most current system or solutions. We then examine a set of properties by which location systems are evaluated, and apply this evaluation method to survey a number of existing systems. Comprehensive performance comparisons including accuracy, precision, complexity, scalability, robustness, and cost are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of emerging technologies including virtual reality, simulation rides, video conferencing, home theater, and high definition television are designed to provide media users with an illusion that a mediated experience is not mediated, a perception defined here as presence. Traditional media such as the telephone, radio, television, film, and many others offer a lesser degree of presence as well. This article examines the key concept of presence. It begins by noting practical and theoretical reasons for studying this concept. Six conceptualizations of presence found in a diverse set of literatures are identified and a detailed explication of the concept that incorporates these conceptualizations is presented. Existing research and speculation about the factors that encourage or discourage a sense of presence in media users as well as the physiological and psychological effects of presence are then outlined. Finally, suggestions concerning future systematic research about presence are presented.},

The tags contain a minimalist microprocessor that ambiently operates in shutdown mode and, upon detecting particular frequency components in the AM-modulated interrogation beam, awakens to decode the incident digital message and produce an appropriate response. The lack of linear amplifiers means that these tags draw under 0.5 $\mu$A when sleeping, hence can operate up to 10 years on a lithium coin cell. Such devices are practical demonstrations of the potential of ubiquitous computing where common, nearly passive objects have a sense of identity and the ability to respond to external stimuli. In our example, the interrogator is a flashlight, with which one scans an area; when the light beam hits a tag programmed with a code that matches that sent by the interrogator, an on-tag LED flashes, indicating that the desired object is found.},

We examine in detail three crucial parts of such systems: user-tracked interaction; real-time, automatic, adaptable animation of virtual characters and deformable pre-computed radiance transfer illumination for virtual characters. We examine our efforts to enhance the sense of presence for the user, while maintaining the quality of animation and interactivity as we scale and deploy our AR framework in a variety of platforms. We examine different AR virtual human enhanced scenarios under the different mobile devices that illustrate the interplay and applications of our methods.}

Our vision is to make the user the multimedia center: the user as the point at which multimedia services and the means for interacting with them converge. This paper proposes the main research goals in providing users with a personalized interface and content independent of physical networked devices, and space and time. As a case study, we describe an indoors, mobile mixed reality guide system: ChloeUniversity. With a see-through head-mounted display (HMD) connected to a small wearable computing de- vice, ChloeUniversity provides users with an efficient way to guide someone in a building. A 3D virtual character in front of the user guides him/her to the required destination.},

  Abstract                 = {Mixed Reality exists in many forms along a continuum from Augmented Reality (reality enhanced by graphics, such as Sutherland's work from more than 30 years ago) to more recent efforts at Augmented Virtuality (graphics enhanced by reality, graphics enhanced by video, etc.). Mixed Reality provides numerous ways to add together (mix) various proportions of real and virtual worlds. However, Mediated Reality is an even older tradition, introduced by Stratton more than 100 years ago. Stratton presented two important ideas: 1. the idea of constructing special eyeglasses to modify how he saw the world; and 2. the ecologically motivated approach to conducting his experiments within the domain of his own everyday personal life. Stratton's seminal work has inspired a wide variety of devices that can be used to augment, deliberately diminish, or otherwise alter human visual perception. The first half of this paper presents some of the problems with the existing taxonomies (e.g. mixed reality) and distinctions (e.g. optical versus video see-through), that arise when we consider reality-modifying devices. The second half of the paper presents various new designs for reality-modifying devices, especially those used to modify only a portion of the visual reality stream, suitable for use in everyday life. These devices have the appearance of ordinary bifocal eyeglasses and reading glasses. Finally, a new kind of reality mediator that uses the eyeglass frames themselves as the mediating element is presented. This design makes it impossible for those other than the wearer, even upon very close inspection, to determine whether or not the eyeglasses contain a reality mediator. Such designs make possible livelong experiments and mediated reality experiences in personal everyday life, without the social stigma associated with obvious reality--modifying devices. },

perspective by way of a head-mounted camera and display together with an
image processing computer worn on the body of the user. The
possibilities afforded by personal imaging include a personal safely
device for crime reduction, a new kind of video conferencing system for
computer-supported collaboration, as well as a new tool for
photojournalism. This article describes work in personal imaging as it

  Abstract                 = {Diminished reality is as important as augmented reality, and both are possible with a device called the Reality Mediator . Over the past two decades, we have designed, built, worn, and tested many different embodiments of this device in the context of wearable computing, Incorporated into the Reality Mediator is an "EyeTap" system, which is a device that quantifies and resynthesizes light that would otherwise pass through one or both lenses of the eye(s) of a wearer. The functional principles of EyeTap devices are discussed, in detail. The EyeTap diverts into a spatial measurement system at least a portion of light that would otherwise pass through the center of projection of at least one lens of an eye of a wearer. The Reality Mediator has at least one mode of operation in which it reconstructs these rays of light, under the control of a wearable computer system. The computer system then uses new results in algebraic projective geometry and comparametric equations to perform head tracking, as well as to track motion of rigid planar patches present in the scene. We describe how our tracking algorithm allows an EyeTap to alter the light from a particular portion of the scene to give rise to a computer-controlled, selectively mediated reality. An important difference between mediated reality and augmented reality includes the ability to not just augment but also deliberately diminish or otherwise alter the visual perception of reality. For example, diminished reality allows additional information to be inserted without causing the user to experience information overload. Our tracking algorithm also takes into account the effects of automatic gain control, by performing motion estimation in both spatial as well as tonal motion coordinates.},

The focus is given on four alternative positioning systems where the GeomETH group at the ETH Zurich has made some experiences. These systems are iGPS, which is a system based on a rotating infrared laser fan, the Locata system that uses GNSS similar signals on pseudolites, the cricket ultra-sound system and a photogrammetric laser beam positioning systems (CLIPS) that is currently under development. As a result it can be noted that there are several unconventional positioning systems on their way that may compensate for the deficiencies of GNSS or total stations.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the TELIAMADE system, a new indoor positioning system based on time-of-flight (TOF) of ultrasonic signal to estimate the distance between a receiver node and a transmitter node. TELIAMADE system consists of a set of wireless nodes equipped with a radio module for communication and a module for the transmission and reception of ultrasound. The access to the ultrasonic channel is managed by applying a synchronization algorithm based on a time-division multiplexing (TDMA) scheme. The ultrasonic signal is transmitted using a carrier frequency of 40 kHz and the TOF measurement is estimated by applying a quadrature detector to the signal obtained at the A/D converter output. Low sampling frequencies of 17.78 kHz or even 12.31 kHz are possible using quadrature sampling in order to optimize memory requirements and to reduce the computational cost in signal processing. The distance is calculated from the TOF taking into account the speed of sound. An excellent accuracy in the estimation of the TOF is achieved using parabolic interpolation to detect of maximum of the signal envelope at the matched filter output. The signal phase information is also used for enhancing the TOF measurement accuracy. Experimental results show a root mean square error (rmse) less than 2 mm and a standard deviation less than 0.3 mm for pseudorange measurements in the range of distances between 2 and 6 m. The system location accuracy is also evaluated by applying multilateration. A sub-centimeter location accuracy is achieved with an average rmse of 9.6 mm.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper focuses on Mixed Reality (MR) visual displays, a particular subset of Virtual Reality (VR) related technologies that involve the merging of real and virtual worlds somewhere along the "virtuality continuum" which connects completely real environments to completely virtual ones. Probably the best known of these is Augmented Reality (AR), which refers to all cases in which the display of an otherwise real environment is augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects. The converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display environments are identified. However, an attempt to distinguish these classes on the basis of whether they are primarily video or computer graphics based, whether the real world is viewed directly or via some electronic display medium, whether the viewer is intended to feel part of the world or on the outside looking in, and whether or not the scale of the display is intended to map orthoscopically onto the real world leads to quite different groupings among the six identified classes, thereby demonstrating the need for an efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to which essential differences can be identified. The 'obvious' distinction between the terms "real" and "virtual" is shown to have a number of different aspects, depending on whether one is dealing with real or virtual objects, real or virtual images, and direct or non-direct viewing of these. An (approximately) three dimensional taxonomy is proposed, comprising the following dimensions: Extent of World Knowledge ("how much do we know about the world being displayed?"), Reproduction Fidelity ("how 'realistically' are we able to display it?"), and Extent of Presence Metaphor ("what is the extent of the illusion that the observer is present within that world?").},

Brief introduction to mixed reality \& to the virtuality continuum
between completely real environments \& completely virtual environments.
 
Identifies 3 aspects that distinguish between real \& virtual;
> extent of world knowledge "how much do we know about the world being displayed?" world unmodelled (computer knows nothing about the contents of the environment) to world completely modelled (traditional virtual real- -ity where the computer has complete knowledge about each object in the environment)
> reproduction fidelity "how realistically are we able to display it?" pertains to both real \& virtual objects
> extent of prescence metaphor "what is the extent of the illusion that the observer is present within that world?" mixed reality displays include highly immersive environments with a strong presence metaphor, but also exocentric type AR displays
 
Identifies 6 different types of display technology that constitute mixed
reality interfaces.
 
Contains diagrams of virtuality continuum, extent of world knowledge,

MIT's Media Laboratory (particularly the Responsive Environments group
under the leadership of Joseph Paradiso) was responsible for essentially
the inaugural work in cross reality, with Joshua Lifton's PhD \& the
associated projects in the group framing 'dual reality', as it was
originally known, as a new application domain for sensor/actuator
networks, virtual worlds \& media creation. Lifton himself confirms that
cross reality \& dual reality are the same thing by different names.

  Abstract                 = {The Internet and virtual worlds are increasingly become a part of our daily lives. Currently these two are not capable of exchanging information, largely because of the lack of a global accepted standard for information exchange. Interaction between the real world and virtual worlds is mostly limited to classic mouse and keyboard devices, and exchange of information between different virtual worlds is virtually non-existent. We present a Use Case in the Metaverse1 project to increase motivation for continued physical exercising for the elderly by connecting real-world devices to virtual worlds, and allow information exchange through the teleportation of virtual objects from Second Life to our custom virtual biking world created in the Logos3D engine. We show that the principle of exchanging information between real and virtual worlds is simple, but the solution is non-trivial and requires not only a globally accepted standard to facilitate information exchange. From the results of a focus-group study, we show that a virtual environment does have the capability to increase motivation for exercising and that users do respond to a virtual exercise coach.},

Thus the visitor of the ancient site is presented with an immersive and innovative multi-sensory interactive trip to the past. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley T Sons, Ltd.},

The first is a low-cost scanning laser rangefinder adapted to accurately track the position of bare hands in a plane just above a large projection display. The second is an acoustic system that detects the position of taps on a large, continuous surface (such as a table, wall, or window) by measuring the differential time-of-arrival of the acoustic shock impulse at several discrete locations. The third is a sensate carpet that uses a grid of piezoelectric wire to measure the dynamic location and pressure of footfalls. The fourth is a swept radio frequency (RF) tag reader that measures the height, approximate location, and other properties (orientation or a control variable like pressure) of objects containing passive, magnetically coupled resonant tags, and updates the continuous parameters of all tagged objects at 30 Hz. In addition to discussing the technologies and surveying different approaches, sample applications are given for each system.},

It allows applications running on mobile and static nodes to learn their physical location by using listeners that hear and analyze information from beacons spread throughout the building. Cricket is the result of several design goals, including user privacy, decentralized administration, network heterogeneity, and low cost. Rather than explicitly tracking user location, Cricket helps devices learn where they are and lets them decide whom to advertise this information to; it does not rely on any centralized management or control and there is no explicit coordination be- tween beacons; it provides information to devices regardless of their type of network connectivity; and each Cricket device is made from off-the-shelf components and costs less than U.S. \$10.We describe the randomized algorithm used by beacons to transmit information, the use of concurrent radio and ultrasonic signals to infer distance, the listener inference algorithms to overcome multipath and inter- ference, and practical beacon configuration and positioning tech- niques that improve accuracy. Our experience with Cricket shows that several location-dependent applications such as in-building ac- tive maps and device control can be developed with little effort or manual configuration.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce TwinSpace, a flexible software infrastructure for combining interactive workspaces and collaborative virtual worlds. Its design is grounded in the need to support deep connectivity and flexible mappings between virtual and real spaces to effectively support collaboration. This is achieved through a robust connectivity layer linking heterogeneous collections of physical and virtual devices and services, and a centralized service to manage and control mappings between physical and virtual. In this paper we motivate and present the architecture of TwinSpace, discuss our experiences and lessons learned in building a generic framework for collaborative cross-reality, and illustrate the architecture using two implemented examples that highlight its flexibility and range, and its support for rapid prototyping.},

Interesting notion of virtual worlds providing "effectively perfect 'virtual sensing', meaning that the system has accurate, fine-grained, real-time information about participants' locations and orientations in the virtual space".
 
Seemingly well-implemented 'mapping' capability, managing how physical and virtual spaces are connected \^{} synchronized. The system can define spatial and structural correspondence between the physical and virtual spaces, etc.
 
Good related work section of the state of Cross Reality as of October 2010.
 
Uses the term 'co-presence'.
 
Distinguishes between 'mixed presence' \& 'cross reality'; "mixed presence groupware includes all systems intended to support simultaneous collocated and remote collaboration, whilst cross-reality systems integrate real and virtual worlds in some useful way".
 
Mentions the Sentient Computing project as anm early cross reality effort, then mentions Lifton as 'recent work'.},

"Second Life is a true virtual world, unconstrained by any resemblance to the real planet." "These worlds are not games, however."
 
The term 'mirror worlds' was coined by Yale CS David Gelernter (Artificial Intelligence is Lost in the Woods, another Technology Review article).
 
Introduces the concept of 'mobile augmented reality'; accessing the data from extensive 3D simulations via 2D displays on location aware phones or whatnot.
 
Points out that Second Life \& Google Earth will probably endure as they are (with the usual upgrades) well into the metaverse era, rather than becoming the second earth concept embodied.
 
Lolworth quote - "...according to technology research firm Gartner, current trends suggest that 80 percent of active Internet users and FOrtune 500 companies will participate in Second Life or some competing virtual world by the end of 2011."
 
"As it turns out, simulations need not be convincing to be enveloping."

Definition of virtual heritage - "Virtual heritage, broadly defined, involves the synthesis, conservation,
reproduction, representation, digital reprocessing, and display of cultural evidence with the use of
advanced imaging technology."
 
"...virtual heritage has long been concentrated on generating digital reconstructions of historical or
archaeological artefacts and sites with enough fidelity to be truly accurate representations of their real
world counterparts."
 
Contrasts between photorealistic \& non-photorealistic computer graphics and that for some users the realism
isn't the most important factor, but rather how believeable \& convincing it is, regardless if the imagery
emulates the physical properties of the real world or not. More 'artistic' means of expression can that do
not necessarily hold true to a photographic view of a site can nonetheless be important to a user's understanding.
 
"In virtual heritage representation, architectural walkthroughs and picture-perfect simulations of objects
have defined a practice where photorealism is considered as perhaps the most important measure of a
successful representation."
 
But...
 
"...the emphasis on achieving a high degree of realism runs the risk of limiting VR reconstruction to the
creation of historically accurate yet static worlds that leave little flexibility for interpretive and/or
educational use."
 
So advanced realistic modelling techniques are good for accuracy \& authenticity, but non-photorealistic methods
can provide appropriate tools for more flexible uses in virtual heritage applications. This paper tries to
combine both photorealism \& interactivity into the same virtual reality framework under the CREATE project.
 
"...heritage is 'as much about the living and evolving place, people, and environment as it is about any
single static monument'"
 
"In the case of an archaeology scholar who intends to restore the ancient monument, the goal is to offer
the possibility to try varied reconstruction hypotheses and choose the most plausible."

  Abstract                 = {Within an embodied cognition framework, it is argued that presence in a virtual environment (VE) develops from the construction of a spatial-functional mental model of the VE. Two cognitive processes lead to this model: the representation of bodily actions as possible actions in the VE, and the suppression of incompatible sensory input. It is hypothesized that the conscious sense of presence reflects these two components as spatial presence and involvement. This prediction was con- firmed in two studies (N ? 246 and N ? 296) assessing self-reports of presence and immersion experiences. Additionally, judgments of â€œrealnessâ€? were observed as a third presence component. A second-order factor analysis showed a distinction between presence, immersion, and interaction factors. Building on these results, a thirteen-item presence scale consisting of three independent components was de- veloped and verified using confirmatory factor analyses across the two studies. Presence is a construct, a variable with various levels and dimensions. Biocca and Delaney (1995, p. 62)},

It offers high accuracy of \~{}10 mm, a locating rate up to \~{}10 cycles/s and is applicable for both tracking mobile and locating static devices. LOSNUS is mainly designed to localize static devices especially in a wireless sensor network (WSN) with numerously deployed sensor/actuator devices which enables substantially improving a lot of aspects of applications, e.g. network integration of nodes, supplying node locations to application programs, supervising locations with respect to accidentally dislocating, automatic setup and detecting faking of node locations. In order to deal with the demand of locating static devices, the system is optimized for cheap implementation and on the other hand for a high resolution of locations. Concept and basic operation, realization of system components and low-cost receiver principles, improved system performance and setup of a test system will be discussed in this paper.},

Two technological dimensions that contribute to telepresence, vividness and interactivity, are discussed. A variety of media are classified according to these dimensions. Suggestions are made for the application of the new definition of virtual reality within the field of communication research.},

  Abstract                 = {The fundamental idea behind the three-dimensional display is to present$\backslash$nthe user with a perspective image which changes as he moves. The$\backslash$nretinal image of the real objects which we see is, after all, only$\backslash$ntwo-dimensional. Thus if we can place suitable two-dimensional images$\backslash$non the observer's retinas, we can create the illusion that he is$\backslash$nseeing a three-dimensional object. Although stereo presentation is$\backslash$nimportant to the three-dimensional illusion, it is less important$\backslash$nthan the change that takes place in the image when the observer moves$\backslash$nhis head. The image presented by the three-dimensional display must$\backslash$nchange in exactly the way that the image of a real object would change$\backslash$nfor similar motions of the user's head. Psychologists have long known$\backslash$nthat moving perspective images appear strikingly three-dimensional$\backslash$neven without stereo presentation; the three-dimensional display described$\backslash$nin this paper depends heavily on this "kinetic depth effect.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes an application of augmented reality (AR) techniques to virtual cultural heritage reconstruction on the real sites of defunct constructs. To realize AR-based cultural heritage reconstruction, extrinsic camera parameter estimation is required for geometric registration of real and virtual worlds. To estimate extrinsic camera parameters, we use a pre-constructed feature landmark database of the target environment. Conventionally, a feature landmark database has been constructed in a large-scale environment using a structure -from-motion technique for omnidirectional image sequences. However, the accuracy of estimated camera parameters is insufficient for specific applications like AR-based cultural heritage reconstruction, which needs to overlay CG objects at the position close to the userâ€™s viewpoint. This is due to the difficulty in compensation of the appearance change of close landmarks only from the sparse 3-D information obtained by structure-from-motion. In this paper, visual patterns of landmarks are compensated for by considering local shapes obtained by omnidirectional range finder to find corresponding landmarks existing close to the user. By using these landmarks with local shapes, accurate geometric registration is achieved for AR sightseeing in historic sites.}

Standardized patients and some partial task trainers, such as intubation heads, have been used for decades. More recently, a growing number of computer-screen simulations, high-fidelity mannequins, and virtual-reality simulators have expanded the number of procedures and conditions, which can be effectively simulated.The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education transitioned to a competency-based assessment of residency programs in 2001 and included simulation as a method for incorporating the 6 core competencies into graduate medical education curricula. Over the past decade, numerous peer-reviewed publications have promoted simulation as an effective educational tool for each of the core competencies.The advanced technology used to operate many current simulators can erroneously become the focus of efforts to create a simulation-based curriculum. Simulation can most effectively be incorporated into EM curricula through the use of time-proven concepts, which start with defining the targeted learners, assessing their general and specific educational needs, defining learning objectives, and selecting the best educational strategy for achieving each objective. In many, but not all, instances, simulation can be the best tool for achieving EM learning objectives.},

Introduction to the issue about cross reality, tries to define the
different types of alternate realities (VR, AR, ER, MR) but I believe
his definition of cross reality to be wrong (he describes what I
consider augmented virtuality).
 
Features a 2x2 matrix that shows the relation between the different
alternate realities. Where he has cross reality (top left) I would place
augmented virtuality.

  Abstract                 = {Second Life (SL) is currently the most mature and popular multi-user virtual world platform being used in education. Through an in-depth examination of SL, this article explores its potential and the barriers that multi-user virtual environments present to educators wanting to use immersive 3-D spaces in their teaching. The context is set by tracing the history of virtual worlds back to earlymulti-user online computer gaming environments and describing the current trends in the development of 3-D immersive spaces. A typology for virtual worlds is developed and the key features that have made unstructured 3-D spaces so attractive to educators are described. The popularity in use of SL is examined through three critical components of the virtual environment experience: technical, immersive and social. From here, the paper discusses the affordances that SL offers for educational activities and the types of teaching approaches that are being explored by institutions. The work concludes with a critical analysis of the barriers to successful implementation of SL as an educational tool and maps a number of developments that are underway to address these issues across virtual worlds more broadly.},

  Abstract                 = {A model of virtual/physical experience is presented, which provides a three dimensional conceptual space for virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) comprising the dimensions of focus, locus, and sensus. Focus is most closely related to what is generally termed presence in the VR literature. When in a virtual environment, presence is typically shared between the VR and the physical world. "Breaks in presence" are actually shifts of presence away from the VR and toward the external environment. But we can also have "breaks in presence" when attention moves toward absence--when an observer is not attending to stimuli present in the virtual environment, nor to stimuli present in the surrounding physical environment--when the observer is present in neither the virtual nor the physical world. We thus have two dimensions of presence: focus of attention (between presence and absence) and the locus of attention (the virtual vs. the physical world). A third dimension is the sensus of attention--the level of arousal determining whether the observer is highly conscious or relatively unconscious while interacting with the environment. After expanding on each of these three dimensions of experience in relation to VR, we present a couple of educational examples as illustrations, and also relate our model to a suggested spectrum of evaluation methods for virtual environments.},

An interactive projection system is used in a theatrical performance, and the registration between the virtual scene (projected image) and the real objects (dancers) is realized through a video camera working in the near infrared waveband. An ultra-light wide-angle head-mounted display system is designed for an interactive exhibition item in a scientific museum, and a multi-user six-degree-of-freedom tracking system is developed for the indoor registration, which uses infrared markers projected on the ceiling and a camera fixed on top of each head-mounted display. A fixed-position viewing system is developed for the on-site digital reconstruction of a historical site, which provides visitors with the visualization of the original magnificent buildings on the natural field of the ruins. The azimuth and pitch of the viewing system are detected by two rotary encoders. A volumetric 3D display based on multi-angle projection is applied in a navigation system for endoscopic sinus surgery. A 3D digital scanner is employed to scan the skin on the patient's head for the alignment between the patient and the 3D model from his CT or MRI images. The registration of the surgical tool is also achieved by optical means through tracking cameras.},

  Abstract                 = {The effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) has often been linked to the sense of presence reported by users of those VEs. (Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability; there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs; individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and individuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.},

The variation of system parameters is also analyzed with the help of plots of image geometry to show their effects on image distortions. The converged (toed-in) and parallel camera configurations are compared and the amount of vertical parallax induced by lens distortion and keystone distortion are discussed. The range of acceptable vertical parallax and the convergence/accommodation limitations on depth range are also discussed. It is shown that a number of these distortions can be eliminated by the appropriate choice of camera and display systems parameters. There are some image distortions, however, which cannot be avoided due to the nature of human vision and limitations of current stereoscopic video display techniques.},

Conventional localization methods usually employ a hybrid approach in which user's position is estimated by combining positioning infrastructures and a pedometer. Since the installation cost of infrastructures increases when the area expands, the measurement method of user's relative position with high accuracy is required. Although a number of methods using a pedometer have been developed to improve the estimation accuracy, these methods generally can handle only usual walking behavior of a user. This paper proposes a new real time localization method for both walking and running users by using a wearable electromagnetic tracker and an inertial sensor. The proposed localization method estimates a moving distance in the period when both legs do not ground by estimating a velocity of waist when user's leg leaves. Experiments have been carried out using a prototype system to evaluate the accuracy of user localization with the proposed method.},

  Abstract                 = {The current paper takes an introspective look at the human-computer interaction (HCI) issues for mobile computing in a variable work context. We catalogue the current research in four major categories. The major findings of our study are following. (1) A majority of HCI issues, about 58\%, fall under the category of computer systems and interface architecture implications. (2) 23\% of the articles focus on development and implementation issues. (3) 13\% of the articles focus on use and context of computer issues. (4) 6\% of the articles focus on human characteristics issues. Further, the literature indicates that the field services is a main application of mobile computing (46\%) followed by sales force (21\%), health care (17\%), fieldwork (8\%), insurance claims (4\%) and journalism (4\%).},

  Abstract                 = {This paper contributes to the presence literature by explicating the meanings and subtypes of copresence. Copresence is defined here as consisting of two dimensions: copresence as mode of being with others, and copresence as sense of being with others. Mode of copresence refers to the physical conditions that structure human interaction. Six such conditions are delineated. Sense of copresence, on the other hand, refers to the subjective experience of being with others that an individual acquires in interaction. The main argument of this paper is that mode of copresence affects sense of copresence, and knowledge of how the former affects the latter will benefit copresence design. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},
