Progress on previous experiment
	tablet based system developed
	evaluated in terms of 1.) FPS 2.) points of interest interaction 3.) free exploration interaction
	to be evaluated in terms of the new following paths interaction style (not quite free exploration, but also not as restrictive as prior 'points of interest' static interfaces)
	published in the field of cultural heritage & in the field of education


Three components of Mirrorshades to be evaluated/experimented upon/explored individually

1.) Accuracy

2.) Stereo vs non-stereo

3.) Cross Reality



1.) Accuracy

Compare accuracy of IndoorAtlas technology in Jack Cole (the ideal location with a metal frame), St Salvator's chapel (a location that I thought wouldn't work well if at all, but actually seems to work okay) & the cathedral (a location that probably won't at all).

2.) Value of stereo images vs mono images (when in a static position, such that location accuracy/movement isn't a variable)

3.) Switching vs blending/opacity, etc.

Is it better to perform discrete switches between real & virtual, or to fade between, or to have one always overlayed on the other with some level of alpha/opacity (& if so which should be the transparent one & what amount of transparency is best)? At what level does the fidelity of a feed (either real or virtual, but particularly real as however real is displayed will be a reduction in quality) render the information imparted by that feed useless?



Then combine all of 1.), 2.) & 3.) for an experiment in St Salvator's chapel with multiple users & perform some sort of qualitative, task-based study.
	Might want to time how quickly a user can achieve a particular task (but being careful that they don't dawdle because they are enjoying/marvelling at the interaction so much)
	Ability to navigate present & switch to stereo view of past
	Might want to use 'expert evaluation' to give results more credibility
