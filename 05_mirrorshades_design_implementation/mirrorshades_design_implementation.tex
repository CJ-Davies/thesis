\label{chapter-mirrorshades}

This chapter discusses the design and development of a parallel reality platform that combines a wide field of view (FOV), stereoscopic 3D, VR head mounted display (HMD) modified with cameras, with an indoor positioning system (IPS), allowing its user to observe and move around their real environment imbued with the ability to alternatively view an immersive VR environment from the equivalent vantage point. Creation of this platform addressed the shortcomings identified in the VTW platform, by using more accurate position tracking, faster and more responsive orientation tracking and a more immersive virtual display.

%Previous XR research approached the vacancy problem by integrating sensor/actuator networks into the environments, such that actions in one could manifest in the other, however direct visual engagement with the virtual environment was only possible from static interfaces at pre-determined locations within the real environment~\cite{Lifton2007a, Dublon2011}. The platform discussed in this document addresses this shortcoming by providing a mobile interface for visual engagement with both environments of a XR system, allowing the user to transition between viewing their real environment and a virtual environment at any time while maintaining the freedom to move around them, multiplexing visual stimuli from their real surroundings and from a parallel, virtual `mirror world'~\cite{Gelernter1993}.

%=========================================================================================================

%A second example of such a situation is found in the book \textit{Ready Player One}, in a scene in which the protagonist users the equivalent of an Internet cafe to access the \textit{OASIS};

%The OASIS is similar to Snow Crash's Metaverse; a fictional multi-user 3D environment with no enforced likeness to the real world, accessed via \textit{``a visor and a pair of haptic gloves''}. The bifocal visor allows this character to switch his attention between the virtual environment of the OASIS and his real surroundings in the Internet cafe.

\section{Learning from VTW}
The development of the VTW platform as a first foray into applying the concept of PR to the field of virtual heritage revealed reservations around quantitative performance and qualitative experience. Firstly and most critically, the accuracy of position tracking attainable by using a GPS receiver, even one of higher specification and real world performance than those commonly found in smartphones, was not sufficient for the envisaged style of interaction. Secondly, the ability of a hand held  display (the tablet) to provide immersive 3D graphics of a complete, atmospheric reconstruction was limited. Moving forward from VTW, a new project was embarked upon to address these concerns with aims to greatly improve the experience of PR in a virtual heritage scenario.

In contrast to VTW, which was intended for outdoor use upon cultural heritage sites where either no remnants or only parts of original structures still stand, the successive platform was intended for use indoors. This not only allowed the investigation of the application of PR to cultural heritage to be expanded to indoor scenarios, for sites where more of a historic structure still stands, but also allowed for the use of an IPS, many of which offer substantially more accurate proven real world accuracy than GPS does for outdoor positioning.

Furthermore, in place of a hand held display such as the tablet used by VTW, the successive platform makes use of a head mounted display offering stereoscopic 3D graphics over a wide field of view, that promises much greater immersion, with a head tracking solution that substantially outperforms the orientation tracking employed by VTW both in terms of accuracy and responsiveness.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{The Mirrorshades Platform}

Figure \ref{systemarchitecture} presents a high level architectural overview of the successive PR platform, dubbed Mirrorshades\footnote{\textbf{Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology} (1986) is a defining cyberpunk short story collection edited by Bruce Sterling, who explains how mirrored sunglasses became a literary badge or totem for the cyberpunk movement, whose fiction has frequently involved immersive multi-user virtual environments and head mounted displays.}. This is a parallel reality platform which allows its user to observe and move around their RW environment whilst wearing a HMD, with their position tracked by an IPS, switching between viewing RW visual stimuli provided by cameras mounted to the HMD and VR visual stimuli from the equivalent vantage point of the reconstruction, as tracked by the IPS. A controller held by the user allows them to trigger these switches between RW and VR. The mobile client that produces the graphical content delivered to the HMD can is carried about the person in a bag/satchel.

\begin{figure}[h]

		\caption{High level overview of the Mirrorshades parallel reality platform.}
		\label{systemarchitecture}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Emphasis should be placed on the fact that the two views, RW and VR, through the function of IPS and head tracking combined with the spatial equivalence of the constituent environments, represent equivalent vantage points within the two environments, differentiating the modality of interaction from the visual perception exchange systems exhibited in an Istanbul church by Mathieu Briand;

\begin{quote}
	\textit{``In an earlier version, set in the Hagia Eirene church in Istanbul, visitors wearing a wireless headgear viewing device could press a button to exchange the image on the screen with that of another of the six headgear cameras, revealing whatever it was pointing at. Visitors were fascinated by the dynamic visual transformations, such as the way the brightly painted floor could suddenly be replaced by the church dome as they wandered around the space.''}~\cite{Jones2006}
\end{quote}

Likewise, the modality of interaction provided by the Mirrorshades platform distances itself from that of Briand's later experiments into `controlled schizophrenia', in which displacement of body and visions were intentional;

\begin{quote}
	\textit{``The audience members wear helmets that incorporate a camera, goggle-style compact monitor, and headphones. The audience members may also carry a connector that can be plugged and unplugged from the nine sockets placed around the museum, in order to exchange audiovisual experiences with others.}

	\textit{When a connector is not plugged into a socket, one sees the environment through his/her own camera. In other words, one walks around seeing the surrounding environment through his goggle monitor. When the connector is plugged into a socket on the wall, the person sees the view taken by one of the three cameras installed in the building, or taken by another camera worn by another audience member whose camera is also connected to a socket.''}~\cite{Jones2006}
\end{quote}

As the different views that a user of the Mirrorshades platform switches between are inherently the same `place', seen from the same vantage point.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{St Salvator's Chapel}

The stage upon which the Mirrorshades platform was designed and developed to perform upon was St Salvator's chapel in St Andrews. Founded in 1450 but internally stripped of its medieval fittings during the Protestant Reformation (1517 - 1648), the chapel looks markedly different in the present day than it did upon its completion. An existing VR reconstruction of the chapel as it stood in the period 1450-1460 and the marked differences between the internal appearance of the VR building and the current building (including the replacement of the original stone roof with a wooden one and drastically different dividing of the internal space) make this chapel an ideal candidate within the context of cultural heritage for the Mirrorshades PR system to be deployed. The magnitude of the changes between the chapel's original state and how it stands today means that AR would not in fact be able to present a faithful image of how the chapel originally looked, but would need to be combined with substantial application of diminished reality to remove present day features that were not there in the past.

\TwoFig{sallies-vrst/sallies-quad-real.jpg}{St Salvator's chapel today.}{sallies-quad-real.jpg}
       {sallies-vrst/sallies-quad-virtual.png}{St Salvator's chapel reconstruction.}{sallies-quad-virtual.png}
       
This reconstruction project has virtually recreated St Salvatorâ€™s chapel as it was built and furnished for Bishop James Kennedy between 1450 and 1460. The chapel was of the greatest significance for the new architectural ideas that it introduced into Scotland, at a time when Scotland was particularly open to external artistic influences. However, although the shell of the chapel survives and remains in use, it has lost its vault, its window tracery and its liturgical furnishings, and it now requires specialist skills to appreciate the quality of its original state. As with other reconstructions from the OVW group, the virtual St Salvator's chapel is a product of a collaboration between architectural, art history and computer science scholarship. On the combined evidence of a highly detailed late medieval inventory and of the architecture itself, it has been possible to show how the chapel was furnished internally with altars, choir stalls, lecterns, screens, stained glass and wall paintings and the virtual chapel is enhanced with lighting. The architectural, liturgical and spatial analysis allows our understanding of the history of the Chapel as a living building to be enormously enhanced by experiencing the building in its original context.

\TwoFig{sallies-vrst/sallies-real-toward-altar.jpg}{St Salvator's chapel looking East, present day.}{sallies-real-toward-altar.jpg}
       {sallies-vrst/sallies-virtual-toward-altar.png}{St Salvator's chapel looking East, reconstruction.}{sallies-virtual-toward-altar.png}

The chapel is an aisle-less rectangle with a three-sided east apse. Deeply projecting three-stage buttresses define the bays, which are now capped by pinnacles of 1861-2. The windows which occupy the full space available between the buttresses no longer reflect their original forms. The main entrance to the chapel was through a doorway in the second bay from the west of the south flank, which is covered by a vaulted porch between the buttresses. Two doorways on the north side presumably opened into a lost sacristy and treasury range.

The interior of the chapel is known to have been covered by a stone vault, which is assumed to have been of pointed barrel form with a decorative pattern of ribs, like the small vault over the south porch. The interior is now covered by an inappropriate timber roof.

\TwoFig{sallies-vrst/sallies-real-from-altar.jpg}{St Salvator's chapel looking West, present day.}{sallies-real-from-altar.jpg}
       {sallies-vrst/sallies-virtual-from-altar.png}{St Salvator's chapel looking West, reconstruction.}{sallies-virtual-from-altar.png}

St Salvatorâ€™s chapel is considered the first Scottish example of a church planned with an aisle-less rectangular main body terminating in a polygonal eastern apse, a type that was to have a long future for a range of Scottish church types. Such chapels were common in university colleges in France and since Bishop Kennedy had a highly placed kinsman in the university of Paris and drew many ideas for the organisation of his college from that universityâ€™s constitution, it is reasonable to assume that he also drew some of his ideas for the architecture of his chapel from there. On this basis, St Salvatorâ€™s must be seen as an outstandingly important channel for the introduction into Scotland of new architectural ideas from France. The new architecture made a significant statement in its Scottish context. 

The reconstruction of the chapel involved both the mental reconstruction of modified and lost features, and the establishment of the range of ways in which buildings that represent a spirituality alien to modern students were intended to function. As such it offers an invaluable academic discipline for those involved in the reconstruction, providing eminently practical ways of testing theories and assumptions. It is then of the greatest value for conveying more widely the understanding that has been gained. The development of a PR system which enables comparison between the real and virtual chapel in the same time and place aims to further enhance the value of the reconstruction.

\section{Virtual Reality Head Mounted Displays}
The concept of virtual reality and the associated head mounted displays that provide wide field of view, stereoscopic 3D graphics coupled with head tracking is currently experiencing a resurgence of interest and investment, thanks largely to the advent of Oculus and their Rift platform. Whilst the first head mounted computer display was created in the late 1960s by Ivan Sutherland~\cite{Rheingold1992}, it was not until the late 1980s and early 1990s that VR began to be pushed to the consumer. Unfortunately, both the hardware and software was not ready for consumer adoption at this time and these systems failed to live up to the substantial hype of being a \textit{``revolutionary technology''} which \textit{``promises to transform society''} (figure \ref{rheingold-virtual-reality.jpg}), resulting in the VR bubble bursting.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{rheingold-virtual-reality.jpg}
		\caption{Howard Rheingold's 1992 bestseller \textit{Virtual Reality}~\cite{Rheingold1992}.}
		\label{rheingold-virtual-reality.jpg}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Decades after this initial disappointment with consumer VR, Oculus now looks set to finally begin realising a successful consumer VR platform, thanks largely to the substantial advances in display technologies made during the past decade driven by the explosive popularity of smartphones and tablets. Pre-Oculus HMDs predominantly made use of two separate microdisplays, one for each eye; Sutherland's original `Sword of Damocles' made use of two tiny CRT screens, whilst later HMDs made use of two OLED microdisplays. As the number of market applications for microdisplay technology was (\& continues to be) relatively small, there are limited models to chose from and they command high prices when considering integration into a consumer device.

Oculus have taken a different approach for their Rift HMD. Instead of using two small displays, one for each eye, it uses a single larger display upon which two separate images are rendered, side-by-side. This approach has two distinct advantages compared to prior dual display techniques. Firstly, the complexity of the device is reduced, which effects both price, integration and content development. Secondly, the cost of a single display in the 5"-7" range is drastically lower than the cost of a pair of microdisplays, thanks to the surging popularity of smartphones and tablet computers. By making use of readily available displays intended for smartphone/tablet manufacturers, Oculus were able to bring their first Development Kit (DK1) to market for researchers and enthusiasts at a price of only \$300, but still providing substantially wider FOV than the vast majority of existing HMDs (even those with vastly higher price points).

For comparison, examples of consumer-grade commercial HMDs that use the twin OLED microdisplay approach, the Sony HMZ-T1, which launched with a price of \textyen60,000 (\$800 at exchange rates of the time) and its successor the HMZ-T2 which launched with a price of \textyen70,000 (\$900 at exchange rates of the time), provide $45\textdegree$ horizontal FOV/$51.6\textdegree$ diagonal and no head tracking (intended primarily as a personal 3D cinema experience), whilst Oculus' DK1 provides more than $90\textdegree$ horizontal and $110\textdegree$ diagonal FOV. Furthermore, the DK1 integrates a head tracking solution operating at a rate of 1kHz and providing best in class accuracy. Combined with advances in both hardware and software tasked with producing 3D graphics, the user experience of Oculus' HMD offerings is promising to finally deliver on the VR promises of 30 years previous.

The March 2014 acquisition of Oculus by Facebook\footnote{\url{https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101319050523971}} for \$2 billion\footnote{\url{http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/22/facebook-oculus-rift-acquisition-virtual-reality}} and Oculus partnership with Samsung, one of the world's leading display manufacturers, which has already led to the release of an innovative VR HMD that makes use of an existing smartphone as its display\footnote{\url{https://www.oculus.com/gear-vr/}}, lends hope that this wave of VR hype will succeed where its hype-laden 90's cousin failed.

\subsection{The Oculus Rift DK1 and Unity Game Engine}

The OVW group took delivery of an Oculus Rift DK1 from the first batch of units shipped to the EU, in August 2013. The immersive experience of using the DK1, thanks to its wide FOV, fast and accurate head tracking, stereoscopic 3D and novelty compared to traditional 2D displays, easily met the requirements of the display aspect of the Mirrorshades platform to exceed that of VTW in terms of user experience.

At this early stage in the DK1's release, the best supported software platform in terms of API provision and integration was the Unity game engine. After experience with modifying the Second Life client with the VTW project, it was decided prudent to convert the OVW group's OpenSim model of St Salvator's chapel into a Unity compatible format, rather than embarking upon further modification to the Second Life client to support the DK1.

One deciding factor in this deliberation was the more stringent performance requirements for an enjoyable HMD experience compared to those of a traditional desktop/handhend display experience; when using a HMD such as the DK1, a high and smooth framerate is required to avoid a kind of motion sickness referred to as `simulator sickness', with Oculus' official guidelines being for Rift applications to \textit{``run at a frame rate equal to or greater than the Rift display refresh rate''}\footnote{\url{http://static.oculus.com/sdk-downloads/documents/Oculus_Best_Practices_Guide.pdf}} which in the case of the DK1 is 60Hz. Due to the possibly ephemeral nature of Second Life content, where users are free to create, modify and destroy content in real time, Second Life as a 3D platform suffers in terms of performance compared to game engines such as Unity due to not being able to exploit techniques such as occlusion culling~\cite{willmott:largecomplex} as these require an offline processing phase that depends upon environmental content to be static and unchanging. The OVW group's experience in presenting Second Life/OpenSim content on a range of different hardware did not point to good odds of managing to render the St Salvator's chapel scene at 60fps, especially when considering that stereoscopic rendering introduces an overhead even when the total resolution of the two side-by-side images is no greater than the single monoscopic image. As Mirrorshades is a mobile application and the computer producing the visuals is carried by the user, the specification of this client are also limited compared to those that the group has used in alternative static deployments.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Modifying the DK1 for See Through Video}
\label{modifying-dk1}
The Oculus Rift DK1 covers the user's entire view, such that they cannot see any of their real world surroundings whilst wearing it, and it does not feature any camera provision to allow a mediated view of the real world to be presented to the user. As such, it was necessary to modify the DK1 to provide such capability. When choosing cameras for this task, there were several desired ideal features;
\begin{itemize}
	\item resolution and refresh rate that match (or exceed) those of the DK1,
	\item sensor aspect ratio that matches that of the DK1's display halves,
	\item combined lens focal length and sensor dimension to provide wide FOV (ideally matching the FOV of the DK1),
	\item ease of integration with the Unity platform.
\end{itemize}

The PS3 Eye camera met most of these requirements. It's resolution is only 640x480 pixels, whilst each half of the DK1's display is 640x800 pixels, however unusually for a USB camera it is capable of running at 60fps (the refresh rate of the DK1). The aspect ratio of the 640x480 sensor is 4:3, which although not identical to the 5:4 aspect ratio of each eye's 640x800 `half' of the DK1 screen is closer than the 16:10 or 16:9 aspect ratio of a `widescreen' camera sensor. Furthermore, once dismantled to its bare PCB it features mounting holes for a standard S-mount (M12x0.5mm) lens mount commonly used for CCTV cameras, allowing alternative focal length lenses to be easily fitted.

A very early test with the PS3 Eye and the DK1\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS0FGZxQzCU}} was performed by simply attaching a single unmodified PS3 Eye camera to the top of the DK1 (figure \ref{rift-pseye-ziptied.jpg}), with its stock lens set to its `wide' setting (75\textdegree, presumably diagonal, FOV\footnote{\url{http://uk.playstation.com/media/247868/7010571 PS3 Eye Web_GB.pdf}}). One purpose of this test was to explore the suitability of Unity's \texttt{WebCamTexture}\footnote{\url{http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/WebCamTexture.html}} feature for integrating the stream from a USB camera into a 3D application. In this early test, the mediated RW video stream was rendered to a small `floating' window that moved with the user's head (figure \ref{floating-webcam-window.png}), allowing the user to view both environments at once, with the real environment in their peripheral whilst they were attending to the virtual. Whilst an interesting concept, the decision was made to instead render the mediated RW stream to the full DK1 screen so as to allow the user to better observe their real environment thanks to the larger image and higher resolution, with the small floating window likened more to the VTW approach of PR than an experience that allows true immersion in the environment of choice. A second benefit of this switching approach is that it helps to mitigate any detrimental affect of latency in the camera image(s) not matching that of the virtual image(s).

\TwoFig{rift-pseye-ziptied.jpg}{Oculus Rift DK1 with PS3 Eye test.}{rift-pseye-ziptied.jpg}
       {floating-webcam-window.png}{`Floating' window see through video in Unity.}{floating-webcam-window.png}

A pair of PS3 Eye cameras were dismantled, removing their outer plastic housing and stock lenses then fitting S-mount lens mounts. Ideally, the lenses used would provide the same FOV as the Rift itself is capable of displaying, such that the mediate RW stream from the cameras could be displayed at the full size of the Rift and `match' the FOV of whatever virtual content would alternatively be displayed. However there is a trade off with lenses between focal length and distortion; shorter focal lengths mean a wider FOV, however they also introduce more distortion which is not necessarily corrected by the shader that the Rift uses to compensate for the distortion of its own plastic lenses through which the image is viewed.

The PS3 Eye has a `1/4'' type' sensor which is only an indication of its true dimensions\footnote{\url{http://www.dpreview.com/glossary/camera-system/sensor-sizes}} and as Sony has not published the actual dimensions of the sensor we adopt the typical 1/4'' type dimensions\footnote{\url{http://www.photoreview.com.au/tips/buying/unravelling-sensor-sizes}} of 4.5mm diagonal, 3.6mm horizontal, 2.7mm vertical for calculating FOV estimations. Empirical accounts of very short focal length S-mount lenses mounted to the PS3 Eye camera indicated that the distortion becomes very high beneath 2.1mm\footnote{\url{http://peauproductions.com/store/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=26_4}}. Table \ref{fov-table} gives the diagonal, horizontal and vertical FOV of the widest readily available S-mount lenses. Whilst 1.7mm lenses would provide almost identical FOV to the Rift's display (105.9\textdegree\ diagonal for the cameras, 110\textdegree\ diagonal for the Rift) the amount of distortion introduced would likely be of such an extent that the experience of viewing the mediate RW environment would be degraded more by distortion than by limited/non-matching FOV of longer focal length lenses, unless the lens' distortion was compensated in a separate stage.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{c *{4}{>{\centering\arraybackslash}X}}
\toprule
\textbf{Focal length (mm)} & \textbf{Diagonal FOV (\textdegree)} & \textbf{Horizontal FOV (\textdegree)} & \textbf{Vertical FOV (\textdegree)} \\
\midrule
2.5mm & 84    & 71.5 & 56.7 \\
2.1mm & 93.9  & 81.2 & 65.5 \\
2.0mm & 96.7  & 84   & 68 \\
1.9mm & 99.6  & 86.9 & 70.8 \\
1.8mm & 102.7 & 90   & 73.7 \\
1.7mm & 105.9 & 93.3 & 76.9 \\

\bottomrule

\end{tabularx}
\caption{FOV of various focal length lenses resolving onto a 1/4'' type sensor.}
\label{fov-table}
\end{center}
\end{table}

However, using a lens with a short enough focal length to provide a FOV as wide as the Rift isn't strictly necessary as, when wearing the Rift, the edges of the image presented to each eye are not necessarily visible to the user, especially if the Rift's adjustable distance from the eyes is adjusted such that it sits at its furthest position. Such adjustment is actually prudent for a user study, as using the Rift at its maximum extension from the eyes ensures maximum compatibility and comfort with users and also removes a variable between users compared to if each user is permitted to chose the extension themselves. Thus the choice of lens can be dictated by identifying the FOV required to fill the portion of the Rift's images that are visible when the headset is extended to its maximal position, rather than by matching the Rift's overall FOV, possibly allowing the use of lenses with focal length long enough that the distortion they introduce is not so bad as to require a separate correction phase.

Experiments revealed that with the DK1 set to its maximum extension, the area of the images visible to the user was wider than that provided by 2.5mm lenses (84\textdegree\ diagonal) when scaled correctly and narrower than that provided by 2.1mm lenses (93.9\textdegree\ diagonal) when scaled correctly. Without easy availability of a lens with a focal length between 2.5mm and 2.1mm it was decided to make use of the 2.1mm lenses. Figure \ref{lens-comparison-on-ps3eye-pcb.jpg} shows the 2.5mm lens (right) and 2.1mm lens (left) mounted to the PS3 Eye PCBs via S-mount lens mounts, while figure \ref{fov-comparison-1.png} shows the FOV of the selected 2.1mm lenses scaled correctly upon the wider FOV of the DK1's images - as previously mentioned, with the DK1 at its furthest extension, users cannot perceive the area outwith the mediated camera image.

The PS3 Eye cameras were mounted to the DK1 by modifying the 3D printable sensor mount design released by the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies\footnote{\url{http://projects.ict.usc.edu/mxr/diy/oculus-sensor-mount/}}. The modified mount comprised a base piece (figure \ref{clips.jpg}) that clips securely over the front of the DK1 and a slotted plate (figure \ref{clips-hori-plate.jpg}) onto which the PS3 Eye cameras are mounted. These parts were 3D printed using a MakerBot Replicator 2X\footnote{\url{http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2x}} and then combined using epoxy resin. The combination is shown attached to the DK1 by figure \ref{hori-1.jpg}. The slots in the slotted plate are spaced to match the mounting holes of the PS3 Eye PCB, such that the cameras can be attached by metal stand-offs (figure \ref{hori-2.jpg}) and can then be easily moved left and right to alter the distance between them to account for different interpupillary distances. Figure \ref{hori-3.jpg} shows how one camera is mounted upside down to allow enough clearance for the PCBs to be moved close enough together to accommodate short interpuillary distances.

Although the initial integration test with a single PS3 Eye camera revealed easy accessibility of the camera within Unity, using two PS3 Eye cameras proved temperamental. Unity's \texttt{WebCamTexture} support identifies webcams via their `name' as provided by their driver. In the case of the PS3 Eye using the driver provided by Code Laboratories\footnote{\url{https://codelaboratories.com/products/eye/driver/}} (this third party driver must be used as no official Windows driver is available with Sony only marketing the PS3 Eye for use with their PS3 console) an issue arises where both cameras present the same name to Unity and the second camera overwrites the reference to the first, only allowing access to a single camera. Figure \ref{ps3-eye-unity-overwrite.png} shows this issue, that whilst Windows' device manager successfully identifies both cameras independently, Unity's \path{WebCamTexture.devices()} function returns a reference to only one (the \texttt{BisonCam, NB Pro} entry is the laptop's internal webcam). A partial solution to this issue was presented by a community provided Unity package\footnote{\url{http://tips.hecomi.com/entry/20130731/1375279561} (Japanese)}, which allowed the setup up to be successfully tested within a departmental building\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy5NqqDtkJ4}}.

\end{figure}

An oversight in the design of the camera mounts was realised by when William Steptoe later released details of his `AR Rift' project\footnote{\url{http://willsteptoe.com/post/66968953089/ar-rift-part-1}}. Although the DK1's overall screen has a resolution of 1280x800 in a `horizontal' 16:10 aspect ratio, each `half' of this screen as presented individually to each eye has a resolution of 640x800 in a `vertical' 4:5 aspect ratio. Thus to best match the aspect ratio of a 4:3 camera sensor, such as that of the PS3 Eye, to each half of the DK1's screen, that camera should be oriented in a portrait orientation rather than the landscape orientation employed thus far by the Mirrorshades platform with the PS3 Eye cameras. Thus new mounting hardware was designed and printed, by further modification of the USC's original 3D designs, allowing for vertical mounting of the PS3 Eye cameras. This new design is shown in figure \ref{clips-vert.jpg} (the recessed section in the centre of the clip allows for the heads of bolts to clear the front of the DK1) and the assembled units are shown attached to the DK1 in figure \ref{vert-6.jpg}. Additionally soon after this point, the metal stand-offs that had been used to mount the camera PCBs to the clips (see figure \ref{vert-1.jpg}) were replaced with a combination of rubber washers and threaded bolts (see figure \ref{vert-4.jpg}) both to reduce the discrepancy in the mediated RW images caused by the distance between the camera sensors and the user's eyes (by reducing this distance) and to allow for finer alteration of the orientation of the cameras.

       {rift-clips-cameras/vert-4.jpg}{Updated camera mount with rubber washers.}{vert-4.jpg}

Unfortunately the PS3 Eye naming solution was temperamental at best and two camera compatibility was frequently lost. It was decided prudent to therefore replace the PS3 Eye cameras with alternatives, rather than attempting to glean a solution to their reliable compatibility with Unity. Using Steptoe's project as a guide, a pair of Logitech C310\footnote{\url{http://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/hd-webcam-c310}} cameras were sourced. Whilst the stated refresh rate of the C310 is only 30Hz, half that of the PS3 Eye, it supports a resolution of 1280x960, which is higher than that of the PS3 Eye and of each half of the DK1's display. Thus the switch from the PS3 Eye cameras to the C310 represented a sacrifice in framerate, but an increase in resolution. Empirically the increase in resolution was however indiscernible, likely due to the effect of the DK1's optics reducing the visual acuity of its display, whilst the reduction in framerate was more prominently noticeable.

The C310 cameras received the same attention as the PS3 Eye cameras; they were dismantled and outfitted with S-mount lens mounts. As the sensor in the C310 is also of the 1/4" type, the FOV provided by the 2.1mm lenses on the C310 cameras is comparable to that of the same lenses mounted to the PS3 Eye cameras. Due to the lack of mounting holes present on the C310 PCB, the PCBs were set into a thin sheet of thermoplastic (figure \ref{thermoplastic.jpg}) which was then attached to the 3D printed clips with the same rubber washer and threaded bolt arrangement as the PS3 Eye cameras. The assembled DK1 + dual C310 solution is shown by figures \ref{vert-7.jpg} (3/4 view), \ref{middle.jpg} (profile view) and \ref{right.jpg} (detail view).

\subsection{Switchable Stereoscopic See Through Video with Unity}

Unity's \texttt{WebCamTexture} support was used to gain access to the C310 video streams within Unity. Due to better provisioned drivers, there was no issue with Unity obtaining references to both C310 as there had been with two PS3 Eye cameras. These video streams were applied to a pair of planes, of matching orientation and aspect ratio to the video stream, that are situated perpendicular to the two virtual cameras of the Oculus Unity prefab. This is shown by figure \ref{unity-screenshot-1.png} in which the smaller portrait planes in the centre of the image are those onto which the camera streams are rendered.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}

        \end{center}
    \end{minipage}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

It can be seen that these planes overlap considerably as they are only horizontally spaced the same amount as the virtual cameras are spaced (see also figure \ref{webcam-overlap.png}), which is derived from the interpupillary distance that the user inputs to the Oculus configuration utility. By placing each of these two planes in a separate layer and setting the culling mask of the virtual cameras to cull/not-cull these layers appropriately (such that the left virtual camera culls the layer of the right plane but not the left plane and the right virtual camera culls the layer of the left plane but not the right plane) the appropriate virtual camera only sees the appropriate webcam image, even though they overlap - the left virtual camera sees only the camera plane shown highlighted by figure \ref{unity-screenshot-2.png} while the right virtual camera sees only the camera plane shown highlighted by figure \ref{unity-screenshot-3.png}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.4\linewidth]{webcam-overlap.png}
		\caption{Visualisation of overlap between camera planes.}
		\label{webcam-overlap.png}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

As the Mirrorshades platform required the user to be able to control which environment they are perceiving, either real or virtual, the visibility of these camera planes (\& the virtual environment behind them) must thus be controllable. The opacity of the camera planes is therefore linked to the control mechanisms, however because the camera planes do not completely fill the DK1's FOV (see section \ref{modifying-dk1} and figure \ref{fov-comparison-1.png}) two further, larger, planes are situated behind the camera planes which cover the entire FOV of the DK1. The opacity of these planes is also linked to the control mechanisms, such that when the user operates the control mechanism in a manner to view VR, they are completely transparent to allow VR visual stimuli to pass, but when the user operates the control mechanism in a manner to see RW, they become opaque in order to prevent any RW visual stimuli from passing around the camera planes. Even though these areas around the mediated camera streams are not strictly viewable, the ambient light that they would produce would pose a detrimental effect.

The arrangement of these planes in relation to the virtual cameras is shown by figure \ref{unity-screenshot-6.png}, where it can be seen that the smaller camera planes do not fill the virtual cameras' frustum due to the lower FOV of the C310 than of the DK1. Figure \ref{unity-screenshot-7.png} shows a space between the camera planes and the backing planes, required to avoid a rendering bug that arose with planes situated so close together.

\subsection{Latency of DK1 See Through Video Solution}

Measurement of the end-to-end latency of the C310 solution was performed by placing the DK1, with the lens cups removed, in front of a LCD monitor displaying a timer\footnote{\url{http://www.flatpanels.dk/monitortest_inputlag_dk.php}}. In this context, end-to-end latency refers to the time taken for a visible change in the scene in front of the DK1 (in this instance, the image upon the monitor) to be reflected by a comparable change upon the DK1's display. This figure accounts for latency introduced by the C310 cameras themselves, by the Unity engine and by the DK1's display. A digital camera was set up on a tripod behind the monitor and DK1, such that it could record both the monitor and the milliseconds value on the DK1's screen. The digital camera was set at a sufficiently high ISO as to record video at 50fps with a shutter speed of 1/4000 of a second.

Both the monitor and the DK1's screen refresh at 60Hz, each frame lasting for 16.67ms, whilst a 1/4000 of a second shutter on a camera means that the shutter is open for 0.25ms. The response time of the monitor (quoted by the manufacturer as 8ms grey-to-grey) was evidently much higher than that of the Rift, as the tenths and even hundredths digit on the monitor was usually legible in each frame of the video whereas on the Rift the hundredths and thousandths digits were always illegible. Thus to determine an estimate of the latency of the DK1 + camera setup using Unity, adjacent video frames were identified where a transition from one tenth digit to the next was legible enough on the Rift's display and the hundredths/thousandths digits were legible enough on the monitor, such as the pair shown by figures \ref{vid1.jpg} and \ref{vid2.jpg}. From these values, it can be inferred that the tenths digit on the DK1's screen (visible through the right eyecup hole) changed from 9 (figure \ref{vid1.jpg}) to 0 (figure \ref{vid2.jpg}) sometime between 181ms (figure \ref{vid1.jpg}) and 198ms (figure \ref{vid2.jpg}) on the monitor, which represents a latency of between 181ms and 198ms. Out of 11 pairs of frames like this identified, 7 pairs showed this 181-198ms latency, while 4 showed 198-215ms latency as in figures \ref{vid3.jpg} and \ref{vid4.jpg}.

\TwoFig{latency/vid1.jpg}{Measuring latency (video frame, 1/2).}{vid1.jpg}

       {latency/vid4.jpg}{Measuring latency (video frame, 2/2).}{vid4.jpg}

In addition to video frames, still photographs taken at the same 1/4000 of a second shutter speed gave some better legible stills which corroborated this 181-251ms figure. This figure is substantially greater than the 30-60ms figure often quoted\footnote{\url{https://www.oculus.com/blog/the-latent-power-of-prediction/}} as the upper limit for an acceptable VR experience, however how much it affects a relatively `slow' style of interaction such as that of applying PR to a cultural heritage site versus that of a `fast' application such as a competitive twitch game is open to interpretation from experimental results.

\subsection{Registration of Camera and Unity Visuals}

As mentioned in section \ref{caseforpr} the registration (the `alignment') between real and virtual objects in the Mirrorshades system is less critical than that of an AR system, as virtual objects in PR are seen as part of a complete VR environment rather than gaining context from their accurate superposition upon a background of the RW environment. Whilst accurate registration will intuitively positively effect the user experience of the Mirrorshades platform, especially when interaction with a reduced maximum opacity of the RW visuals (see section \ref{subsub-baseopacity}) is considered, the context provided to virtual objects by their wider virtual background and an emphasis on an interaction style that switches between environments rather than permanently overlays one upon the other means that highly accurate registration is less of a concern than for many applications of AR. In fact registration accuracies insufficient for successful AR experiences may well be quite sufficient for successful PR experiences.

This lessened requirement for accurate registration allows the Mirrorshades platform to operate using just the DK1's head tracker without what Azuma refers to as `additional registration strategies'~\cite{Azuma1997}. This tracker provides 1Khz sampling with roughly 2ms delay (from head movement to Unity receiving the data) and most importantly thanks to sensor fusion performed over data from accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer, drift is reduced to negligible levels. Mitigating drift in the head tracking solution was important for Oculus as it is a requirement for any VR experience that has a fixed reference point such as \textit{``a game with a cockpit, where your headâ€™s orientation does not affect the position of whatever car/plane/mech youâ€™re piloting''}\footnote{\url{https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game/posts/380099}}\saveFN\rifttrackerfn. It would result in a poor VR experience if drift was allowed to mount between a user's head orientation and this fixed reference point - \textit{``imagine re-orienting your head back to perfect center but in-game you're now looking slightly left or right''}\useFN\rifttrackerfn.

In the case of Mirrorshades, the fixed reference point is the chapel - both the RW and the VR chapel, as they occupy the same `place'. By making sure that the two chapels are aligned at the beginning of each session, the negligible drift in the head tracker means that sufficient registration between the two environments is maintained throughout, without the need to introduce any additional registration strategies. This alignment is effected by knowing the starting orientation of the virtual cameras in the VR chapel and then physically placing the DK1 in the corresponding orientation in the RW chapel. This starting orientation in the VR chapel is shown in figure \ref{sallies-rift-frame-of-reference.png} and producing the same orientation with the DK1 is trivial as it is parallel with the architecture of the building (including the floor tiles, which proved to be a useful grid to accurately align the DK1 against).

\subsection{Constraints of DK1 See Through Solution}

\label{constraints_of_dk1_see_through_solution}

Whilst the FOV of the image produced by the C310 is sufficient to fill the area of the DK1's screen visible when extended to its furthest position, there are other aspects of the camera solution to consider, including the depth of field (DoF) of the camera solution and the fixed convergence of the cameras.

Due to the fact that depth of field of an image captured by a camera increases both as lens focal length and sensor size decreases, combining a short focal length lens (such as the 2.1mm used in the solution) with a small sensor (such as the 1/4'' type used in the solution) results in a plenty sufficient depth of field when looking through the DK1 with C310 so as not to feel markedly different in this respect to viewing in the same lighting conditions with bare eyes.

With regards to convergence, when viewing an object in the real world the eyes rotate such that the perpendicular axes that bisect each eye converge at the point that one is looking at. This results in disparity between the images produced by each eye, as each sees the object from a different angle due to the physical distance between the eyes. This disparity leads to stereopsis which is one of the contributing factors that leads to our ability to perceive depth. Oculus exploit this situation with their HMDs, by presenting a slightly different image to each eye, allowing virtual objects to appear at varying distances behind or in front of the virtual display.

For a stereo camera video see through solution, however, the convergence between the cameras is fixed, unless one were to implement a complex system employing eye tracking to dynamically physically reorient the cameras to match the orientation of the eyes. Thus one can either chose to mount the cameras parallel to each other, such that their optical axes never converge/converge at infinity, or to fix them `toed-in' such that they converge at a non infinite distance.

With parallel cameras, any object captured by the cameras at infinity will be cast to the virtual screen. However any object captured by the cameras closer than infinity will be cast in front of the virtual screen with negative parallax. Viewing an entire scene in this manner is uncomfortable and should be avoided. With toed-in cameras, objects behind the convergence point will be rendered with positive parallax and will appear to be behind the virtual screen, whilst objects before the convergence point will be rendered with negative parallax and will appear to be in front of the virtual screen.

With toed-in cameras, the distance of the convergence point from the user should be chosen to sit somewhere in the middle of the environment and task. For Mirrorshades, this distance was set by trial and error to be somewhere in the region of 15 to 20ft, which resulted in the most comfortable and natural feeling experience when engaging in the sort of behaviour of a visitor to a cultural heritage site such as St Salvator's chapel, which involves mainly observing aspects of the building and architecture in this sort of distance range.

Toed-in cameras lead to both depth plane curvature, which causes objects at the corners of the image to appear further away than those toward the centre, and , keystone distortion, which causes vertical discrepancy between each image, as the cameras' sensors are oriented in different planes, such that for one camera an image will appear larger at one side than the other, whilst for the other camera the image will appear larger on the other side~\cite{Woods1993}. As with depth plane curvature, keystone distortion is worse toward the corners.

It should also be noted in this discussion that the DK1's combination of optics and rendering shader means that the user's eyes focus at infinity. This is intentional, as focussing on a far away plane is less strenuous than focussing on one closer, especially one only a few inches from the eyes. However this has the effect that the user is focussing their eyes at infinity, whilst perceiving objects at varying distances between them and infinity. This is a caveat inherent to the DK1 that cannot be avoided, however it should be noted that this is an additional degradation to the user's view of their RW environment whilst using the experimental setup, compared to viewing the RW environment directly.

A further consideration is the discrepancy between the cameras' sensors and the users' eyes, caused due to the fact that the cameras must be mounted to the front of the DK1 and thus several inches in front of the user's eyes. This has the effect of making the user experience viewing the real world from several inches in front of where their eyes truly are (as if their eyes were `on stalks'), whilst viewing VR through the same setup does not have this effect. The distance between the sensors and the user's eyes was reduced when iterating from the first mounting mechanism with metal stand-offs (figure \ref{deep-mounts.jpg}) to the second mechanism with rubber washers (figure \ref{shallow-mounts.jpg}), however with the interaction style of Mirrorshades where the user is predominantly focussed on observing objects and architecture 15-20ft away from them the discrepancy is not particularly noticeable - it is when trying to manipulate objects much closer to the eyes that the discrepancy becomes prominent.

\TwoFig{rift-clips-cameras/deep-mounts.jpg}{Early camera mounts, large eye/sensor distance.}{deep-mounts.jpg}
       {rift-clips-cameras/shallow-mounts.jpg}{Later camera mounts, smaller eye/sensor distance.}{shallow-mounts.jpg}

%Because of the approach that the DK1 uses to produce a `3D' image, by using side-by-side stereoscopic rendering where each eye receives a different image, with these images horizontally separated on the single screen, the solution does not feature zero parallax.

%By displaying a different image to each eye, which are 

%This is however inherent to all side-by-side stereoscopic HMDs and is not a product of the modifications to the DK1 to afford it with video see through capabilities.

\section{Indoor Positioning Systems}

For outdoor applications, GPS represents a suitable solution for the vast majority of position tracking requirements. Global coverage and the ability to scale accuracy as required, from many metres with a basic GPS receiver such as those integrated into smartphones, to a few metres with SBAS augmentations and further to as little as 10cm with the (costly) deployment of Differential GPS (DGPS) beacons, has led to GPS occupying the role of the `go to' solution where position tracking is required for an outdoor application. For indoor applications however, there is no single technology or solution that provides similar coverage or suitability as GPS does outside: a large number of different technologies have been employed to produce Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS), which are summarised in figure \ref{mautz-table.png} taken from Mautz~\cite{Mautz2012}.

\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{mautz-table.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Overview of IPS technologies}
	\label{mautz-table.png}
\end{table}

Because of this diversity in technology, with different IPS solutions covering various swathes of the continuums of accuracy and coverage (see figure \ref{Mautz-000.png}, from Mautz~\cite{Mautz2012}), introducing a host of performance and suitability considerations, it is necessary to carefully consider the requirements of the application (see figure \ref{Mautz-003.png}, from Mautz~\cite{Mautz2012}) and then choose the best suited of the many different IPS approaches. Unsurprisingly, selection of a particular IPS usually leads to balancing these requirements in a trade-off, as each of the challenges of indoor positioning effects each technology more or less than others~\cite{Mautz2009}.

\TwoFig{Mautz-000.png}{IPS technologies plotted against their accuracy and coverage.}{Mautz-000.png}
       {Mautz-003.png}{Requirements parameters of IPS.}{Mautz-003.png}

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{IPS Requirements for Mirrorshades}
The positional accuracy of the IPS used for the Mirrorshades platform needs to be substantially higher than that of the GPS solution used for VTW. As a pedestrian application wherein the user walks through doorways (whether real or virtual) and observes multiple rooms within a building, it is necessary to achieve a level of accuracy that allows, for example, reliably discerning between adjacent rooms, between doorways and their surrounding walls and for approximating position within rooms and corridors.

Coverage required depends largely upon the size of the cultural heritage site that Mirrorshades is deployed to. However it is prudent to select an IPS that can scale quite arbitrarily from small scenarios (perhaps of a small village church) to substantially larger scenarios (such as a cathedral similar to that at St Andrews), such that the suitability of the platform isn't restricted to sites of particular sizes.

A high update frequency is not especially important to Mirrorshades. The envisaged style of interaction is one wherein users walk relatively slowly through the environments, as they wish to observe and take in their surroundings. Updates in the range of several hz will be sufficient, especially if users are attending more to their real environment than the equivalent virtual environment when actively moving around (which is to be encouraged, as one cannot walk through an unattended RW obstacle as one can a VR one). Similarly, low latency is not critical. Even if the IPS takes a few seconds to `catch up' with the user, because the user is committed to a deliberate study and comparison of their real and virtual surroundings they are not going to be foiled in their task if they find they have to wait momentarily when switching from real to virtual views.

Cost represents a more concrete restriction for Mirrorshades, as the costs of installing and using different IPS range drastically. For example, an IPS that locates users via propagation modelling/empirical fingerprinting/pathloss of WiFi signals can make use of existing WiFi infrastructure installed in a building and use nothing more expensive than a smartphone carried by the mobile user. Conversely, using a motion capture suit as an IPS solution will incur substantial costs for each suit, with additional costs for the supporting infrastructure. In a similar vein to the vision of Mirrorshades, an existing project combined the Oculus Rift HMD with an Xsens MVN motion capture suit, allowing participants to walk around a virtual environment of the same layout and dimensions as their real environment\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtMfrkRqlRs}}, but without any video see-through of the real environment. The use of a motion capture suit allowed extremely accurate positional tracking, however as a \textit{``complete standard Xsens MVN system is available at around \euro{}50,000''}\footnote{Personal correspondence with Xsens EMEA Entertainment Business Manager.} and requires a not insubstantial setup phase of the participant donning the suit, it is unsuitable for a virtual heritage scenario where budget is likely to be substantially more limited and  where visitors are unlikely to be willing to don a complex motion capture suit in order to explore the site. To illustrate a real world comparison of the trade off between costs, accuracy, frequency, etc. of different IPS technologies, considering the departmental building shown by \ref{jack-cole-splodges-red.png}, \textit{``To cover ground floor and have room level accuracy in each room + tracking in the corridors, the cost would be ca. \$25,000''}\footnote{Personal correspondence with Sonitor Technologies Vice President Sales and Business Development EMEA and APAC.} for a commercial ultrasonic IPS.

Reliance upon deployed infrastructure such as beacons and markers also needs to be avoided for Mirrorshades if possible, as most cultural heritage sites will not allow the installation of any such infrastructure into the site/environment, or may only allow strictly temporary infrastructure to be deployed. Approaches that require extensive infrastructure to be deployed, or for which the deployment and calibration phase of infrastructure is long and thus not suitable for temporary deployments, are therefore unusable. Similarly, intrusiveness of the IPS used for Mirrorshades needs to be considered such that the IPS does not drastically affect the user's ability to observe the real and virtual sites around them.

Robustness of all aspects of a virtual heritage system is critical for enjoyment and beneficial experience by the user. Visitors to a cultural heritage site, especially if they are only visiting for a short period of time in passing, are not going to be pliant to waiting for a malfunctioning virtual heritage system to right itself. Furthermore, many virtual heritage systems are installed by experts into locations where the permanent on-site staff do not have the technical knowledge or experience to troubleshoot and repair them, so these systems must be robust enough to continue successful operation for extended periods of time without intervention by knowledgeable administration.

\subsection{PlayStation Move}

An initial technology investigated for suitability as an IPS for use with Mirrorshades was PlayStation Move (PSMove), a game controller platform released by Sony for use with their PlayStation 3 console. The platform comprises a hand held controller which contains inertial sensors and has a plastic sphere on its end that is illuminated from within by a RGB LED. The bundled PS3 Eye camera uses vision tracking to track the controller's position in relation to itself. Through use of the PSMove API~\cite{Perl2012}, the PSMove platform can be used by a regular computer, by making use of the OpenCV\footnote{\url{http://opencv.org/}} computer vision project.

Whilst the PSMove has been used successfully for pedestrian position tracking in previous projects, included those that used an Oculus Rift HMD\footnote{\url{http://projects.ict.usc.edu/mxr/blog/project-holodeck-wows-in-dublin/}}, it quickly became apparent when auditioning the platform that it only performs reliably when in very dimly lit conditions. Even the relatively dim scene shown by figure \ref{psmove-screenshot.png} represented too much ambient light for reliable tracking, so the suitability of the platform for use at a cultural heritage site was not evident.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Indoor Atlas}

During the evaluation phase of different IPS and their suitability to the envisaged Mirrorshades platform, Finnish startup IndoorAtlas\footnote{\url{https://www.indooratlas.com/}} released the first public beta of their indoor positioning technology that uses the magnetometers found in smartphones to locate a user within a magnetic `fingerprint' of a particular building, taking inspiration from animals, such as the spiny lobster, that are able to determine their position in addition to their direction from the Earth's magnetic field~\cite{Boles2003}. A spin out from research at the University of Oulu in 2009~\cite{Haverinen2009,Haverinen2009a}, with a similar project undertaken by Media Lab researchers in 2011~\cite{Chung2011}, IndoorAtlas exploits how the Earth's magnetic field is distorted by both natural and man-made sources. Indoors, these distortions come from building materials, especially in structures employing a framework of metal beams, but also from electrical cabling, HVAC ducting, etc. By recording a map of these distortions in an offline mapping phase, producing a fingerpint of the magnetic field around a building, the location of a user can be deduced by comparing the readings from their smartphone's magnetometer to this fingerprint in real time.

IndoorAtlas promised to be a good match for the IPS requirements of the Mirrorshades platform. In particular, the lack of dependence upon any deployed infrastructure such as ultrasound beacons or visual tracking targets suits the deployment area of Mirrorshades well, as most cultural heritage sites will not be amenable to the deployment of such hardware. Furthermore, the reliance upon only a smartphone held by the user means that coverage is only limited by the area that has prior been mapped in the offline mapping phase, allowing the positioning to scale to arbitrarily large indoor cultural heritage sites. This dependence upon only a smartphone also meets the low cost requirement of the Mirrorshades platform, as mid to high end smartphones with sensitive magnetometers can presently be purchased for just a few hundred dollars.

The major concern at this point was whether the building materials employed in the construction of cultural heritage sites such as chapels, castles and cathedrals would create great enough distortions to the Earth's magnetic field for IndoorAtlas to provide its boasted accuracy, which would be sufficient to discern between adjacent rooms, between doorways and their surrounding walls and estimate position within rooms and corridors. These building materials are largely various types of stone, along with wood, a far cry from the metal framework that permeates most modern buildings. Whilst initial tests of the IndoorAtlas beta technology within a departmental building\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-eIvzpScRs}}\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hc2zEeQJXQ}} of roughly 40m and 30m tall were promising, this was a modern building with a steel beam structure and an abundance of computing infrastructure and its associated cabling and cooling provision (see figure \ref{jack-cole-ceiling.jpg}). Figure \ref{jack-cole-splodges-red.png} shows the results of one of these tests, with each red dot representing a position reported by the IndoorAtlas platform while walking around the building at a slow walking pace ($<1$ms$^{-1}$, akin to how a visitor to a cultural heritage site might walk.

\TwoFig{jack-cole-splodges-red.png}{Positions reported by IndoorAtlas within department building.}{jack-cole-splodges-red.png}
       {jack-cole-indooratlas-routes.png}{Route mapped in department building during offline phase.}{jack-cole-indooratlas-routes.png}

It should be noted that the IndoorAtlas technology only reports positions upon routes that have been previously mapped in an offline mapping phase; for the test results shown by figure \ref{jack-cole-splodges-red.png}, this offline mapping phase comprised walking the route shown by the thick black line in figure \ref{jack-cole-indooratlas-routes.png} several times. In the subsequent test, had the user deviated from this route, IndoorAtlas would still have reported them as being somewhere upon it; it would not attempt to extrapolate their position into unmapped territory. This is presumably because the scale of distortions in the Earth's magnetic field is quite fine grained, supported by the fact that many of the black dots are less than a meter apart, thus extrapolation would not fair well. This is an important aspect to take into account when performing the offline mapping phase, as one must map sufficient paths to cover all possible places and routes that a user may walk. For locations comprised mainly of corridors and small rooms, this is not an issue, however for a location that contains a large open space in which the user is free to meander, a more involved mapping process in which the entire space is systematically covered by back and forth routes that progress across the space is required.

Initial testing of IndoorAtlas at St Salvator's chapel proved surprisingly successful, with the platform able to track the smartphone accurately throughout the building even without any obvious overbearing metal content in the structure or its furnishings. Figure \ref{sallies-splodges-red.png} shows the set of positions reported by the IndoorAtlas platform whilst walking throughout the chapel, which is roughly 30m across, after an offline mapping phase that mapped the routes shown in figure \ref{sallies-indoor-atlas-routes.png}.

       {sallies-indoor-atlas-routes.png}{Routes mapped in St Salvator's chapel during offline phase.}{sallies-indoor-atlas-routes.png}

Upon closer inspection of the building, metal grating that runs along the ground along the central aisle, representing much of the horizontal movement in figure \ref{sallies-splodges-red.png} and shown in figure \ref{DSCN0172.jpg} and figure \ref{DSCN0174.jpg} in detail, which also extends to the open area in front of the altar as shown in figure \ref{DSCN0175.jpg}, may explain this unexpectedly high performance, however in other areas such as when walking to either side of the altar (far right of figures \ref{sallies-splodges-red.png} and \ref{sallies-indoor-atlas-routes.png}) there were no obvious sources of magnetic interference (see figure \ref{DSCN0176.jpg}) to account for the maintained accuracy. Possible less obvious explanations could be possible ferromagnetic properties of the stone used in the building's construction and the presence of electrical lighting and audio systems installed into the chapel (loudspeaker and light fixture visible in figure \ref{DSCN0177.jpg}) which presumably make use of electrical cables routed throughout the building.

\section{Mobile Client}
\label{mobile-client}
Although the Unity engine allows for executables to be built for myriad platforms, including popular mobile platforms such as Android, iOS and Windows Phone, at the time of Mirrorshades' development the only platforms upon which Oculus' Unity integration for the DK1 was available were Windows and Mac OS standalone and community efforts to support the DK1 on Android were at a rudimentary stage of functional head tracking but no distortion shader\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO2Vt8CuxsA}}. Thus the mobile client used for the Mirrorshades platform was a small Windows laptop computer, an 11'' Clevo W110ER with an Intel i7-3632QM 4-core/8-thread processor, Nvidia GT 650M graphics card and 16GiB system memory, to be worn in a satchel that would also serve to hold other hardware and cables required for the platform to operate.

Since the development of Mirrorshades, Oculus' have partnered with Samsung to produce the Samsung Gear VR, a device that combines Samsung's Galaxy Note 4 smartphone with a HMD housing containing lenses and head tracker, to produce a mobile VR HMD. Although not available at the time of the development and experimentation with Mirrorshades, Gear VR now represents an ideal platform for a PR system such as Mirrorshades to be implemented upon. Whilst the graphical quality of the visuals of a smartphone based approach may not match those of a laptop powered approach, the physical modality of the Gear VR is ideal for a mobile application such as the PR exploration of a cultural heritage site, as even in a more graceful setup as those used during Mirrorshades experiments the reliance upon a separate HMD, laptop, smartphone and control device make for a physical modality not suited for anything but research in the lab or field. As Gear VR is based around an Android smartphone it would not only remove the requirement for separate HMD and client to produce its visuals, as the hardware and software provision to operate IndoorAtlas is already present within the Note 4 and the Gear VR HMD housing even features an input area that would negate the requirement for the user to carry a separate control device to perform transitions between their real and virtual environments.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Integrating IndoorAtlas and Unity}

Due to the role of the mobile client being filled by a laptop computer, position data obtained via IndoorAtlas using an Android smartphone had to be relayed to the laptop. Modifications were made to an IndoorAtlas SDK beta example app, such that it submits position data to a remote MySQL database server via a PHP/HTTP POST mechanism. This not only allows the mobile client to determine its position by polling the database server for the most up-to-date data, but also allows for remote logging (unrestricted by local storage on the smartphone) and for other applications to easily make use of the location data; during development, a Web based visualisation of the position data was used for both the department building (figure \ref{indooratlas-webpage-jack-cole.png}) and St Salvator's chapel (figure \ref{indooratlas-webpage-sallies.png}). These Web pages render the position of the user as a red mark using a relative position \texttt{div} and served as a source of diagnostic information that was quickly accessible from any platform.

\TwoFig{indooratlas-webpage-jack-cole.png}{Web visualisation of IndoorAtlas information for department building.}{indooratlas-webpage-jack-cole.png}
        {indooratlas-webpage-sallies.png}{Web visualisation of IndoorAtlas information for St Salvator's chapel.}{indooratlas-webpage-sallies.png}

Translating RW positions reported by IndoorAtlas into VR positions within the Unity environments is performed in a similar same way as RW positions reported by GPS were translated into VR positions within the OpenSim environment in section \ref{second_life_position_control}, except that the myriad formats that position data are reported by the IndoorAtlas API negates the requirement to use the haversine formula. As well as providing indoor positions in the form of longitude and latitude pairs, the API also provides positions as offsets from the origin of the floorplan image file used when performing the offline mapping phase, in both pixels and meters. Thus, instead of deriving the displacement between the anchor point and the user's position by using haversine to calculate great circle distances between pairs of longitude and latitude, the displacement is instead obtained by simply adding/negating the position of the user reported in meters from the position of the anchor point also in meters. This approach is possible with IndoorAtlas as the use of a floorplan image provides a frame of reference, that can be indexed by 2D pixel coordinates and converted into meters using a pixels-per-meter value, that did not exist with the GPS approach adopted for VTW but that requires no offline mapping phase.

%\begin{figure}
%	\begin{center}
%		\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{Jack-Cole-unity-anchor-new.png}
%		\caption{Anchor point (yellow) and avatar position (red).}
%		\label{Jack-Cole-unity-anchor-new.png}
%	\end{center}
%\end{figure}
	
Using IndoorAtlas reported positions in Unity is configured and achieved by a combination of two scripted objects. One object, the anchor point, simply contains fields for the entry and storage of the RW position information of the anchor point (see figure \ref{unity-anchor-point.png}). In the Unity environment this object can be rendered with no texture or collider, such that it does not interfere with the environment in any way, but by using a dedicated object for the anchor point rather than attaching the script to another object, the anchor point object itself can be moved throughout the environment to the correct VR position instead of the user having to enter these details in addition to the corresponding RW ones and this inferred position then used in the calculations.

Thanks to the ability of the Unity engine to build applications for myriad platforms, the integration of IndoorAtlas IPS into Unity could be tested within the department building using a pair of Android smartphones\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3lEnXZMjms}} before moving on to the full DK1 based setup. This can be seen in figure \ref{indooratlas-two-phones.png}, where the smartphone in the right hand (a Google Nexus 4) is running the modified IndoorAtlas SDK beta example app, POSTing position data to the remote MySQL server, while the smartphone in the left hand (a Google Nexus 5) is running a Unity application that depicts a top-down view of the user's current position within a 3D model of the department building.

\section{Informing Transitions Between RW and VR}
Attending to visual stimuli from the RW environment via the cameras is required for the user to safely move around. Delay in IndoorAtlas reporting their position and inaccuracies in these position data mean that moving around while attending only to visual stimuli from the VR environment would not be safe for the user, even with unchanging RW obstacles with perfectly accurate representations in the VR environment - an unlikely scenario considering a cultural heritage scenario, in which it is extremely likely that many RW obstacles will not have equivalent VR representations. Whilst one can walk through a virtual wall, the same is not true of a real one! Thus the `default' view through the DK1 must display enough of the view through the cameras for the user to safely navigate their environment, including any obstacles within it (whether these are static objects such as walls and furniture, or dynamic objects such as other humans). For the user to alternatively view through the DK1 a scene that is more, or completely, virtual, thus requires a transition to be performed in which the visual stimuli presented to the user via the DK1 are changed from the default view to the new view.

As discussed in section \ref{transitions_in_parallel_reality}, when a user experiences such a transition from viewing the visual stimuli of one environment (or combination of environments) to viewing the visual stimuli from another environment (or different combination of environments), this will have an effect upon their sense of presence - a break in presence, defined in this context as a deflection along the focus axis of the combined Milgram/Waterworth model (see figure \ref{focus-locus-sensus-with-virtuality-continuum}) from presence and toward absence.

These breaks are undesirable, as they stand to make the act of performing a transition between two environments (or combinations of environments) unpleasant, to detract from the fundamental purpose of allowing the user to transition between environments and could even act to deter users from triggering these transitions when they wish to. Thus, implementing these transitions in a manner that minimises the severity of the breaks is integral to the realisation of an enjoyable and useful mobile PR platform for use in cultural heritage.

At the most abstract level, there are two aspects of a transition that can be altered to investigate their effect upon the severity of the breaks they cause;
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the starting and ending position upon the locus axis;
	\item the implementation of replacing one set of visual stimuli with the other.
\end{enumerate}

Considering the first aspect, the difference in breaks in presence is illustrated by considering the scenario represented by figure \ref{focus-locus-sensus-with-virtuality-continuum-with-transition}, in which the user performs a transition between an environment that is wholly RW (at the `bottom' of the locus axis) and en environment that is wholly VR (at the `top' of the locus axis), with the scenario represented by figure \ref{transition-mix-vr.png}, in which the user performs a transition between an environment that is a mix of the RW and VR environments as perceived from the equivalent vantage point and the VR environment in isolation.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{transition-mix-vr.png}
		\caption{Visualisation using the combined Milgram/Waterworth model of the theorised experience of a user of a PR system performing a transition between a RW/VR mix and the VR environment.}
		\label{transition-mix-vr.png}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

In the former scenario, the user is expected to experience greater focus when engaging with RW than when engaging with the RW/VR mix in the latter scenario, as comprehending the mixed environment requires a greater degree of conceptual/abstract reasoning to understand how the two environments mesh. However in the latter scenario, performing a transition between the RW/VR mix and the wholly VR environment results in a much lesser deflection upon the focus axis, as instead of being presented with a completely new environment they are instead presented with a solidification of the VR environment that they were already perceiving to a lessened extent when engaging with the RW/VR mix.

Considering the second aspect, the difference in breaks is illustrated by once again considering the scenario represented by figure \ref{focus-locus-sensus-with-virtuality-continuum-with-transition} but this time comparing it to figure \ref{transition-rw-vr-hard.png}. In the former, the visual stimuli of one environment are gradually replaced with those of the other (such as by performing linear interpolation upon the opacity of the textures), while in the latter, the visual stimuli of one environment are instantaneously replaced with those of the other. The instantaneous switching will come as more of a shock to the user than the gradual exchange, resulting in a worse break in presence and thus greater deflection upon the focus axis, but also requiring a greater length of time of receiving visual stimuli from the VR environment before understanding them. The gradual replacement also allows the user to temporarily perceive a mixed environment, which grants them some small amount of the same benefits as outlined for the first aspect.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{transition-rw-vr-hard.png}
		\caption{Visualisation using the combined Milgram/Waterworth model of the theorised experience of a user of a PR system performing am instantaneous transition between its constituent RW and VR environments.}
		\label{transition-rw-vr-hard.png}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

In order to best implement PR for situations such as cultural heritage, ascertaining the optimum manner in which to perform these transitions between the constituent environments is important. As such, a number of different transition methods were designed and implemented for evaluation through user studies.

Granting the user the ability to trigger transitions between different visual stimuli, including the ability to choose different styles of transition, requires the user to be provided with a control mechanism. This control mechanism needs to detract as little as possible from the user's ability to process the visual stimuli that they are receiving from the DK1 and as the camera solution mounted to the DK1 is set up in a manner such that looking at things close to the user (such as a physical control) in order to differentiate between different controls to trigger different styles of transition would be uncomfortable due to the heightened negative parallax (see section \ref{constraints_of_dk1_see_through_solution}), a control modality that can be quickly learned and then used by touch/memory is necessary.

Using the smartphone upon which IndoorAtlas operates did not represent a good solution, as a lack of physical buttons meant that triggering different transitions would require touching different areas of the screen - a task that would not be reliably performable without looking at the phone each time. As the smartphone must be held in the user's hand (placing it in a pocket or in the satchel was attempted, however a severe negative impact on the performance of IndoorAtlas was experience) the control mechanism must be usable with the remaining single hand. An Xbox 360 controller is thus used to accomplish this goal. When held with just the right hand, the controller features multiple push buttons and an analogue trigger accessible to the thumb and first finger. These buttons are easily distinguishable from each other via touch, due to their simple geometric layout, while the provision of an analogue trigger allows for user controllable transition speeds in addition to simple triggers. Pressing one of the buttons, or pulling the trigger, causes a transition to trigger, while releasing the buttons and trigger cause the default view to return to the DK1 (whether that is wholly RW or a RW/VR mix).

%=========================================================================================================

\section{Transition Types}

Four different styles of transition were implemented for the Mirrorshades platform, three that are triggered by the user via the controller and one that occurs automatically at timed intervals. In addition, a mode that changes the default visual stimuli from wholly RW to a mix of RW and VR, to control the starting and ending position upon the locus axis, is provided.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Hard switch}
\label{sub-hardswitch}
The user presses and holds the \texttt{[A]} button on the controller to switch the visual stimuli displayed by the DK1 from the default to VR. When the \texttt{[A]} button is released, the visual stimuli displayed by the DK1 switch back from VR to the default. This is a `hard' or `immediate' switch with no fading or transition effect. Figure \ref{scenario1} illustrates this scenario while figure \ref{transition-rw-vr-hard.png}, discussed in the previous section, alludes to the expected user experience of this transition upon the combined Milgram/Waterworth model (assuming a default environment that is wholly RW).

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{switching-hard-with-controller.png}
		\caption{Instantaneous hard switch between RW and VR visual stimuli.}
		\label{scenario1}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Transition with linear interpolation}
\label{transition-with-linear-interpolation}
The user presses and holds the \texttt{[B]} button on the controller to switch the visual stimuli displayed by the DK1 from the default to VR. When the \texttt{[B]} button is released, the visual stimuli displayed by the HMD switch back from VR to the default. This switch fades between the default and VR  visual stimuli using linear interpolation on the opacity of the game objects that the webcam feeds are rendered upon. Figure \ref{scenario12} illustrates this scenario while figure \ref{focus-locus-sensus-with-virtuality-continuum-with-transition}, discussed in the previous section, alludes to the user's experience of this transition upon the combined Milgram/Waterworth model (assuming a default environment that is wholly RW).

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{switching-soft-with-controller.png}
		\caption{Switch with linear interpolation between RW and VR visual stimuli.}
		\label{scenario12}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Analogue selectable opacity}
\label{analogue-selectable-opacity}
The user pulls the right analogue trigger (\texttt{[RT]}) on the controller, where the position of the trigger maps directly to the opacity of the game objects that the camera feeds are rendered upon. The user can choose to stop at any intermediary position that suits their needs, keeping the level of opacity of the camera feeds at that position, as well as controlling the rate at which the visual stimuli from the default environment fade (by changing how quickly they change their depression of the trigger). Pulling the trigger all the way in displays only visual stimuli from the VR environment, while releasing it completely displays only visual stimuli from the default environment. The number of intermediary positions is limited only by the resolution of the trigger and the encoding of the value.

This method allows the user to superimpose VR visual stimuli upon default visual stimuli at any level that they wish. This is similar, but not identical, to AR, as instead of displaying a small number of virtual objects upon the user's view of their RW environment, a complete VR environment is superimposed upon the user's view of their RW environment. Figure \ref{scenario2} illustrates this scenario, while considering the combined Milgram/Waterworth model this method in essence allows the user to control the severity of the deflection upon the focus axis by altering the speed at which the oscillation upon the focus axis is performed to suit their disposition, the current environmental conditions, the task at hand, etc.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{switching-analogue-with-controller.png}
		\caption{Analogue selectable opacity between RW and VR visual stimuli, where any intermediary position can be lingered upon.}
		\label{scenario2}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

%=========================================================================================================

%\pagebreak

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Periodic hard switches}
\label{subsub-periodic}
Independent or in addition to any of the previous scenarios, the visual stimuli displayed by the DK1 switch from default to VR at a set interval and for a set amount of time. For example, every 3 seconds the stimuli switch from the default to VR for 0.2 of a second before switching back from VR to the default. Any user triggered transitions cause the interval timer to be reset, such that an `automated' switch will never occur after less time from a user triggered switch than the set interval. Automated transitions are disabled whilst \texttt{[RT]} is at all depressed. Figure \ref{scenariotimed} illustrates this scenario, where \texttt{i} represents the interval between switches and \texttt{d} represents the duration of the switch from RW to VR.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{timed-switch.png}
		\caption{Periodic instantaneous hard switches between RW and VR visual stimuli.}
		\label{scenariotimed}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Considering the combined Milgram/Waterworth model the periodic glimpses of the VR environment are expected to lessen the deflection upon the focus axis when performing a transition, in a similar manner as to how changing the default environment from wholly RW to a RW/VR mix is expected to achieve the same (see figure \ref{transition-mix-vr.png}), however without necessarily causing the associated increase in sensus and decrease in focus when viewing the default environment that a RW/VR mix is expected to entail.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Reduced maximum opacity}
\label{subsub-baseopacity}
Independent or in addition to any of the previous scenarios, the maximum opacity of the game objects that the webcam feeds are rendered upon is reduced, such that the default position at which a transition has not been triggered (either by a button press, trigger movement or by a periodic switch) displays a mix of VR superimposed upon RW. Figure \ref{scenariobaseopacity} illustrates this scenario in combination with a hard switch (from section \ref{sub-hardswitch}) in which the user triggers hard switches between the default position of a superimposition of VR upon RW and a position where only VR stimuli are present, while figure \ref{transition-mix-vr.png} shows this concept upon the combined Milgram/Waterworth model when combined with a linear interpolated transition.

\section{The Assembled Mirrorshades PR Platform}

Figure \ref{experimentalimplementation} presents an overview of the individual components and services that make up the Mirrorshades PR platform as used in user studies at St Salvator's chapel.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\thispagestyle{empty}

		\includegraphics[width=.925\linewidth]{experimental-implementation.png}
		\caption{Implementation of Mirrorshades PR platform.}
		\label{experimentalimplementation}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Hardware Components}
The hardware components of the system that are carried by the user comprise;
\begin{itemize}
	\item an Oculus Rift DK1 HMD modified by the addition of a stereo camera video see through solution comprising 2x Logitech C310 webcams modified with S-mount lens mounts and 2.1mm lenses to provide approximately 81.2\textdegree\ horizontal FOV of the RW environment;
	\item a 12000mAh USB battery pack, capable of outputting 2.1A at 5V, to power the DK1;
	\item a Clevo W110ER laptop computer, with an Intel i7-3632QM four-core/eight-thread processor, Nvidia GT 650M graphics card, 16GiB system memory and a SSD to allow safe operation while moving;
	\item a Google Nexus 5 smartphone, running Android 4.4.4;
	\item an Xbox 360 wireless controller, with USB receiver;
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{DSCN0198.jpg} shows an overview of this hardware; the laptop computer is bottom left, the DK1 control box (with USB battery pack, 4-port USB hub and Xbox controller receiver) is bottom right, the DK1 itself (with camera solution attached) is top right, the Xbox controller is top center and the Nexus 5 smartphone is top left. Figure \ref{DSCN0191.jpg} shows a detailed view of the USB battery pack (white, bottom), the DK1 control box (directly above battery), the USB hub (on top, right) and the Xbox controller receiver (top, left). The use of a USB hub allows there to be only two wires running between the control box bundle and the laptop, which can be seen in figure \ref{DSCN0198.jpg} - the grey cable atop the laptop is the cable from the USB hub and carries the DK1 head tracker information, camera feeds and Xbox controller commands, the black cable is the HDMI cable that carries visual output from the laptop to the DK1. Unlike the DK2, which is powered solely by its USB connection, the DK1 requires an external power source as it draws more power than a single USB socket on a computer can provide. Luckily, this external power supply is rated at 5V, the same as a USB connection, so a USB battery pack that provides sufficient current (more than a computer's USB sockets, but less than high powered USB wall chargers and battery packs) could be used to enabled the DK1 to be used mobile.

\TwoFig{DSCN0198.jpg}{Hardware of the Mirrorshades platform carried by the user.}{DSCN0198.jpg}
       {DSCN0191.jpg}{Detail of Mirrorshades control box bundle.}{DSCN0191.jpg}

The laptop and control box bundle are carried in a satchel hung over the user's shoulder, the smartphone is held in their left hand and the Xbox controller is held in their right hand. In addition to this hardware carried by the user, a remote server is used to provide a MySQL database. During the user studies at St Salvator's chapel, the server used had an Intel Xeon E3-1270 four-core/eight-thread processor, 32GiB RAM, 4x WD RE4 1TB hard disks in software RAID6 and 100mbit/s Internet connectivity. This server ran the Debian stable release, with a standard LAMP stack and mdadm for RAID management.

\subsection{Software Components}
The software components of the system comprise;
\begin{itemize}
	\item an Android application that runs on the Nexus 5 smartphone, determines the location of the smartphone within the building that it is in using IndoorAtlas and submits these location data via PHP to a database server;
	\item a PHP page on the database server that allows IndoorAtlas position data to be submitted to MySQL;
	\item a MySQL database server that stores location data for the phone and allows these data to be accessed by any SQL capable client;
	\item Web visualizations of position data held within the MySQL database for both the department building and St Salvtor's chapel;
	\item a Unity application that runs on the laptop, combining a virtual model of the building, experienced with the DK1's head tracking, with RW camera streams, controlled via Xbox controller actions and the IndoorAtlas position data polled from the MySQL database server.

Due to the use of a SSD with high transfer rates, the video stream sent to the DK1 from the Unity application could be recorded to the SSD, which by using Nvidia's ShadowPlay\footnote{\url{http://www.geforce.co.uk/geforce-experience/shadowplay}} technology, is accomplished without a measurable detriment to framerate of the application. Unlike traditional software video capture solutions such as FRAPS\footnote{\url{http://www.fraps.com/}}, which read individual frames from the graphics hardware's back buffer and then encode them using the CPU, ShadowPlay makes use of hardware accelerated support built into the GPU to perform the capture and encode process upon the GPU and thus reduce the overhead introduced by FRAPS like methods.

\subsection{Execution}
The Unity application hosts the VR representation of the chapel and takes in feeds from both cameras, the DK1 head tracker and the Xbox controller. It also polls the MySQL server for the most recent position data. All of these inputs are combined together to form the visual output for the DK1 to display to the user. As the user moves their head, the visuals that are presented to them upon the DK1's display change accordingly; the RW visuals change due to the cameras being physically fixed to the DK1 and the VR visuals change due to data from the head tracker being used to change the orientation of the in game `cameras' accordingly.

Alignment between RW and VR is achieved simply by placing the DK1 in the appropriate orientation before starting the Unity application - the Unity prefab that encapsulates the avatar functionality has a known virtual origin orientation and knowing this allows the DK1 to simply be oriented to match it to align the RW and VR visuals. The drift inherent in the DK1 head tracker means that this alignment will eventually decay until it negatively affects the user experience, however in the initial tests of the platform in preparation for user studies it became apparent that the length of time required for this drift to post a problem is substantially longer than the amount of time a user is expected to use the platform for exploring a site such as St Salvator's chapel. Most visitors (without using the Mirrorshades platform) to the chapel were observed to spend roughly 5 minutes walking through and observing the building and tests of roughly 15 minutes duration with the Mirrorshades platform revealed no noticeable drift from the original quality of alignment.

As the user changes their position by walking, the visuals that are presented to them upon the DK1's display also change accordingly; again the RW visuals change due to the cameras' physical position upon the DK1 whilst the VR visuals change due to the user's position, as reported by the smartphone and IndoorAtlas, being used to move the position of the relevant Unity prefab to the equivalent position within the VR representation. As the user presses buttons or pulls the trigger upon the Xbox controller, the visuals that are presented to them upon the DK1's display transition between RW and VR in different styles depending upon which button/trigger was activated.

\section{Initial Testing}
\label{initial-testing}
The completed Mirrorshades platform was initially tested within the department building\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy5NqqDtkJ4}}, as shown in figures \ref{testing-vids-screenshots/jc-1.png} to \ref{testing-vids-screenshots/jc-2.png}. Note that this test took place with an earlier PS3 Eye based camera solution in which the camera feeds were rendered to the full expanse of the DK1's display, rather than the later C310 solution in which the camera feeds have their FOV correctly scaled to the DK1's display (see section \ref{modifying-dk1}). This initial integration test confirmed the correct functioning of the platform as a whole and that the accuracy of the IPS was great enough for the desired modality of interaction, at least within the department building with its abundance of metal building materials and electrical provisions.

The first test in St Salvator's chapel\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oPIHIr9Z4}}, as shown in figures \ref{testing-vids-screenshots/sallies-first-1.png} and \ref{testing-vids-screenshots/sallies-first-2.png}, confirmed that the accuracy of the IPS within the chapel was great enough and that the wireless network provision within the chapel was of sufficient speed and stability to support the operating of the platform.

Testing then took place with members of the Open Virtual Worlds research group\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvGV5dCjt4U}}, as seen in figures \ref{testing-vids-screenshots/sallies-second-1.png} to \ref{testing-vids-screenshots/sallies-second-8.png}, to provide initial feedback from participants not involved closely with the design and development of the platform. During these early tests, there was already a strong preference expressed from the participants toward the transition with linear interpolation (see section \ref{transition-with-linear-interpolation}) which is why in the following first stage of user studies this was the transition adopted for those in which there was only a single user-controllable transition style.

\section{Summary}
This chapter has covered the development of the hardware and software that together comprise Mirrorshades parallel reality platform. Building upon the lessons of the previous VTW platform, Mirrorshades permits parallel reality experiences with greater positional accuracy and substantially improved virtual immersion. The platform combines an Oculus Rift DK1 HMD with a stereo video see-through solution and the IndoorAtlas indoor positioning system. Several different styles of performing transitions between real and virtual stimuli have been implemented and their predicted effects represented using the combined Milgram/Waterworth model.

Initial testing of the platform was conducted with members of the OVW research group, first within a departmental building and then within St Salvator's chapel itself, which is introduced as an ideal real world location for a case study into the use of Mirrorshades within the field of virtual heritage. Latency measurements were performed and while not ideal, latency of real world visuals did not arise in this initial testing as a substantial detractor to the enjoyment or utility of the platform during these initial trials.
