"...because humans interact within groups, the multiplexing of their mutual blended realities rapidly creates a PoSR"

"As people use the Internet, they are increasingly mixing their online behaviour with their `real life' behavior."

"These new behavior patterns are revealed as some people spend more time on the Internet and networked devices, than locally with each other..."

"With the addition of sensor networks, a future Internet (the `Internet of Things') based on Dual Reality, Mixed Reality and other technologies, will allow for a more synchronous, albeit networked, simultaneous human experience."

"...an intermediary between whatever virtual and `real'... ...worlds a person happens to be multiplexing"

(wrt augmented reality, dual reality, mixed reality) "Those terms do not currently address the multiplexing scenario that will be commonplace amongst groups of humans using the future Internet simultaneously. ...we suggest the term PolySocial Reality (PoSR)"

"PoSR is the way that humans will be using the Future Internet. Within a sensor/actuator connected environment, humans will be generating data in the physical world that will simultaneously interface with any one of multiple environments. This means that one action in the physical space, could trigger results in numerous applications such as Second Life, Facebook, foursquare, Twitter, Massive Multi-player Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG), geotracking, or any one of many that haven't been implemented such as health records or some type of family notification program."

"Lifton does not fully address the social element and aspects of Dual Reality. In part, this results from the rather 'fixed' locations that he is linking, and by his restriction of the social components to those people in the lab who share both aspects of the dual reality. The introduction of mobility via phones and other devices to the context will require a generalisation of the concept of Dual Reality."

"...there are serious issues even with the simple case of Dual Reality involving one locally mobile person."

"PoSR builds on a modification of Lifton's definition of Dual Reality: "An environment resulting from the interplay" among two or more dual realities."

"Unlike the base Dual Reality concept, additional hardware is not required (other than infrastructural advancement in network and computing technology), though the underlying sensor and actuator flows must be available within a PoSR architecture for additional processing in creating a consistent environment..."

"...prepare for the eventualiy of multiple relationships and orientations with the real world, and all virtual spaces."

"In particular, we look at the impact on social relations in a polysocial world where people must develop means to blend their own realities with those of others."

"...creating new social group models for human interaction"

"Some people may use mobile technology to augment their current social experience, simultaneously checking into a representational space on foursquare... ...whilst physically occupying a real life environment. Others extend physical space when they connect to a network and interact with mobile devices during wait cycles in airports, stores or public transit."

(wrt dual, mixed, blended & augmented reality) "What will be critical is the capacity for people to construct, relate and integrate multiple unique configurations of these..."

"Thus, the pervasiveness of communications technology provides a mechanism for people to take physical space for granted in a different way than before: to cerebrally occupy a 'non-place', whilst their bodies are simultaneously established in a physical place."

"At any given moment, as people are interacting with mobile devices in the 'non-place' they are intersecting and/or colliding with others in 'place', who may not own such devices."

"People still balk as they dodge those unaware 'non-placers', even while they are connecting with their own devices"

"...altering the physical space into a hybrid of concurrent 'place' and 'non-place'."

"The precipice that we are all about to plunge into in our future is that the of a pervasive society where 'non-place' becomes the new 'place' and there is no 'downtime' from the network, or its ability to serve us. This can be a societal asset, freeing us up for other endeavors."

"As people use the Internet, they are increasinly mixing their online 'non-place' behavior with their real life 'place' behavior."

"...Dual Reality (a condition by which things are both happening in grounded reality (real life) and the network)..."

"The future Internet will not only encompass a single person and their laptop, computer or mobile phone, but will reside as an intermediary between whatever virtual and 'real' (cultureally constructed and experienced) worlds a person happens to be multiplexing at any given time."

"...within the context of the Future Internet, using terms like 'Augmented Reality', 'Dual Reality', 'Blended Reality', and 'Mixed Reality' ('Virtual Reality' is omitted for lacking interactivity with other worlds) may be limiting in scope. Those terms do not currently addres the multiplexing scenario that is commonplace amongst groups of people using the Internet simultaneously, each with a different multiplexed set of 'mixed' realities. The complete set of those multiplexed 'mixed realities' connected through the social networks that they reside within, we refer to by the name of PolySocial reality (PoSR)."

"Within a sensor/actuator connected environment, humans will be generating data in the physical world that will simultaneously interface with any one of multiple environmnets. This means that one action in the physical space, could trigger results numerous applications such as Second Life (a virtual world), Facebook, foursquare (an app based on using physical location to update status within a network), Twitter, Massive Multi-player Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG), geotracking apps, or any one of many others that haven't yet been implemnented such as direct input to health records or some type of family notification program."

"At present, though, the closest that technology gets to the PoSR model in mass commercial use at the moment is when a geolocal app uses the mobile phone as a single sensor."

"With ubiquitous communications, people are simultaneously in specific physical 'places' and network 'non-places'. In summary, people now navigate a world which is based on free variables in human constructions, rather than specifically based on space and time."

"We use the term 'Geolocomtion' to describe the way that people navigate through space using the capabilities of geospatial technologies to monitor and control movement in context."

"Lifton discusses the 'vacancy problem' in relation to users of virtual worlds both with respect to their (lack) of presence in their local 'reality' when engaged in a virtual world and the paucity of the virtual world when users are not engaged. He proposes that Dual Reality potentially address the 'vacancy problem' by making both the place (local reality) and the non-place (virtual reality) interoperable in some respects by mapping information from each to the other using real, or virtual, sensors. This is also a useful concept for discussing social and cultural issues arising from the increased use of technologies to support the user experience for augmented, mixed and blended realities. Lifton does not fully address the social element and aspects of Dual Reality. In part, this results from the rather 'fixed' locations that he is linking, and by his restriction of the social component to those people in the lab who share both aspects of the dual reality. The introduction of mobility via phones and other devices to the context will require a generalisation of Dual Reality.

Although there are a number of mobile applications that incorporate augmented and mixed reality, there are serious issues even with the simple case of Dual Reality involvinf one locally mobile person. At its most serios, it is potentially dangerous. One study relating accidents and mobile phone use..."

"The problem becomes compunded when we consider that once we have truly dual realities, these will in fact rapidly become compunded, as people begin to simultaneously engage in multiple dual realities, or introduce their own sub-dual realities within a virtual world. The latter introduces new development concerns, because either only the virtual aspect of the sub-dual reality can be represented in the virtual world or we find ourselves having to implement both the virtual aspect and a virtual representation of the other-local physical aspect.

Descriptively, some of this could be subsumed under present concepts of Mixed Reality or Blended Reality, but as Lifton notes, these do not address the same issues as Dual Reality. Dual Realitiy relates to interoperability between the two realities through sensors and actuators, not simply by rendering one in the other. Furthermore, once we start to consider two or more people interacting in contexts where they share one common virtual world between them, together with different local realities and possibly additional virtual environments, dual or not, interoperability becomes very complex. To avoid both physical danger as a result of local vacancy in the worst case, and to maintain effective and engaged relationships, sufficient information about the experienced reality of all the participants must be exposed to each other, and must become a part of their own experiences of reality."

"...underlying sensor and actuator flow within a PoSR architecture may support a moderated, mutually consistent, environment in the case of two or more people. Moderation is not just a rendering into a composite reality, but results in a new reality, that is simultaneously mutually consistent with each underlying reality."

"Due to differences in knowledge, the field of sensory awareness and other factors, two people will not experience a PoSR in the same way (just as two people in the same location do not experience the same reality), but their experience will be based on compatible viewpoints on the same PoSR."

"The new model for communications is one of creating experiences of physical and derived multiplexed communications spaces in personal, asynchronous time, using new capabilities created by the self and other humans within many cultures."

"When the pervasiveness of mobile devices becomes saturated and integrated into the society, there will be no 'non-place' vs 'place' for people."

"...are describing what we refer to as PolySocial Reality (PoSR), the multiplexed, asynchronous or synchronous individuated data creations that we are all making constantly to each other and which have been increased by the rapid popularity of Social Media, geolocative apps and the combination of people wanting to attempt to do more than one thing at one time."

"We do not think that there is dual reality. We primarily believe that there is one reality, and within that, we use the concept of PolySocial Reality (PoSR) to describe the phenomena and behavior we are seeing by continual, synchronous or asynchronous, individuated, multiple and multiplexed, time and space shifted communications."

"Mixed and Dual Reality do not fully represent or address the complex usage cases developing as more people do more things, with more software at more times and in more spaces than ever before."

"we discuss ways that developers can use PolySocial Reality (PoSR) to represent a more complete complex structural model of individuals interacting within multiple environments."

"To fully exploit location awareness, future interaction design development for the User Experience (UX) will be increasingly directed by users as they create new capabilities situated in social, physical, and network space."

"As much as we'd like to separate that which is 'social' from that which is in the environment, we cannot, for these are interdependent."

"...suggested PolySocial Reality (PoSR) as a term for the conceptual model of the global interaction context within which poeple experience the social mobile web."

"PoSR is based upon the core concept that dynamic relational structures emerge from the aggregate of multiplexed asynchronous or synchronous data creations of all individuals within the domain of networked individuated networked or local experiences. In other words, PoSR describes the aggregate of all the experienced 'locations' and 'communications' of all individual people in multiple networks at the same or different times."

"For example, a PoSR context emerges when a person is walking down the street and talking on the phone and texting and another person is doing the same thing with them while both parties may be communicating through different channels to other people as well."

"PoSR describes the network transaction space that humans are inhabiting themselves and with others in order to maintain their relationships and engage in new activities with collective dependencies via the social mobile web."

"If a person is processing multiplexed data creations and another person is processing others, and both people come together, how is commonality determined by and between the parties? If a third person joins in, how are they able to sort out where there is common ground? PoSR space can get very,, very complex, pretty quickly."

"Our main purpose is to try to make more concrete how developers might leverage PoSR contexts to create more dynamic complexity aware applications."

"Concepts such as Dual Reality and Mixed Reality, and their subsequent technologies were sufficient for most location aware applications, but not sufficient to meet the opportunities and capabilities that location aware applications are opening up. PoSR is capable of representing these relationships, while including multiple users' relative viewpoints."

"When we remotely access data and interact with others, while simultaneously moving and interacting within our immediate locale, our individual experiences become multi-threaded, or 'poly-social'. As a result, our very conceptions of time and space have become personalised and mostly asynchronous, with the mobile phone often acting as a tool for applying a 'just-in-time' model for social planning.

PolySocial Reality (PoSR) describes the multiple, sometimes overlapping, network transaction spaces that people traverse synchronously and asynchronously with others to maintain and use social relationships, and has been developed as a theoretical framework for the global interaction context within which people experience the mobile social web and other forms of communication and social interactions, whether co-located or mediated by technology."

"PoSR is a theory... ...that defines relations across the aggregate of all the experienced locations and communications of and between all individual people in multiple networks and/or locales at the same or different times. A simple example of a PoSR context occurs when two people are walking together down a street, while simultaneously texting or communicating through both digital and analog channels that are partially or wholly interleaved, or that replace face-to-face interactions with interactions in a single, dual or multiplexed fashion. PoSR is based upon the core concept that dynamic relational structures emerge from the aggregate of multiplexed asynchronous or synchronous interactions of all individuals within the domain of networked, non-networked, and/or local experiences. We intend to use PoSR to describe and analyse principles underlying instantiations of the emergent 'network' comprised by the union of all individual networks, such that patterns in an overall graph representing these can be identified, node-centric projections examined, and sub-graphs compared. Simply put, PoSR helps identify the extent and impact of shared and unshared experience when people are interacting in social networks (both analog and digital)."

"PoSR is a model that includes multiplexity as a basic network property. We are looking, however, at properties of subnetworks whose nodes have differential distributions of multiplexity structure."
