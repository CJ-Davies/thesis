Vacancy problem
> largely due to the inability with current tech to immerse oneself in a 3D synthetic environment whilst maintaining awareness/ability in grounded reality
> Lifton proposes dual reality (later 'cross reality') as a possible way to address this
> but as Applin notes, Lifton's experiments didn't address the social element/aspects/implications of dual reality, as (***and?) the linked points were fixed and were limited to the interior of the closed Media Lab environment

*** needs to talk about how we can interact/control a synthetic environment whilst still being in control of real

*** allude to fact that as people want to maintain a presence in the Web \& in social networks \& are more \& more seen using 2D Internet-delivered content such as maps/directions, reviews, etc. \& as many things shift toward using 3D, people are going to want to be able to interact with 3D content in a good way (eg properly immerse, rather than using a 2D smartphone screen) $-$ so it is prudent to look at addressing the vacancy problem today :)
- applin talks about exactly this, even mentioning Lifton's dual reality, defines polysocial reality etc.
- castronova talks about people wanting to remain connected to game worlds more

> cross reality is complete real \& synthetic environments
	> complete unto themselves, but affect one another by sensors/actuators/multidirectional flow
> original concept has spatial/locational equivalence
	> but doesn't necessarily need spatial equivalence
	> synthetic environment could represent/visualise things differently or situate them elsewhere

> past cross reality research hasn't really looked at interacting with both environments simultaneously
	> people would interact with the real environment (\& their actions trigger changes in the synthetic)
	> people would sit at computers \& interact with the synthetic environment (actions triggering real)
	> the vacancy problem
		> cross reality allows somebody in real environment to trigger things in synthetic
		> but real person can't interact with synthetic that well
		> synthetic user can't move around real that well

1.)

ubiquitous mobile devices leading to convergence of different views (virtual/personal/asynchronous and group-oriented/synchronous)

``as people use the Internet, they are increasingly mixing their online behaviour with their `real life' behaviour''

``these new behaviour patterns are revealed as some people spend more time on the Internet and networked mobile devices, than locally with each other, and/or may have behaviour that changes as a result''

``with the addition of sensor networks, a future Internet (the Internet of Things) based on Dual Reality, Mixed Reality and other technologies, will allow for a more synchronous, albeit networked, simultaneous human experience''

``future Internet... ...will reside as an intermediary between whatever virtual and `real'... ...worlds a person happens to be multiplexing''

``PolySocial Reality is the way that humans will be using the Future Internet... ...one action in the physical space, could trigger results in numerous applications such as Second Life, Facebook, foursquare...''

``(dual reality) is a useful concept for discussing social and cultural issues arising from the increased use of technologies to support the user experience for augmented, mixed and blended realities... ...Lifton does not fully address the social element and aspects of dual reality. In part, this results from the rather `fixed' locations that he is linking, and his restriction of the social component to those people in the lab who share both aspects of the dual reality. The introduction of mobility via phones and other devices to the context will require a generalisation of the concept of dual reality.''

``...once we start to consider two or more people interacting in contexts where they share one common virtual world between them, together with different local realities and possibly additional virtual environments...''

``enough information about the experienced reality of all the participants must be exposed to each other, and must become part of their own experience of reality.''

``...prepare for the eventuality of multiple relationships and orientations with the real world, and all virtual spaces.''

2.)

``...the pervasiveness of communications technology provides a mechanism for people to take physical space for granted in a different way than before: to cerebrally occupy a `non-place', whilst their bodies are simultaneously established in a physical place.''

``At any given moment, as people  are interacting with mobile devices in the `non-place' they are intersecting and/or colliding with others in `place', who may not own such devices'' - or who may own such devices but be using them to interact with a different `non-place'

``The precipice that we are all about to plunge into in our future is that of a pervasive society where `non-place' becomes the new `place' and there is no `downtime' from the network, or its ability to serve us.''

``grounded reality'' == reality

``With ubiquitous communications, people are simultaneously in specific physical `places' and network space `non-places'''.

...problem becoming compounded when people start simultaneously engaging in multiple dual realities, or introducing their own sub-dual-realities within the virtual world(s)

``PoSR builds on a modification of... ...Dual Reality'' - an environment resulting from the interplay among two or more dual realities

``...an underlying sensor and actuator flow within a PoSR architecture may support a moderated, mutually consistent, environment in the case of two or more people''

``When the pervasiveness of mobile devices becomes saturated and integrated into the society, there will be no `non-place' vs `place' for people.''
