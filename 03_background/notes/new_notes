Previous XR says that you  don't become absent from one environment whilst in the other if you have manifestations of actions in the other

MShades sayd that you don't become absent from one environment whilst in the other if you are able to switch between visually observing each environment with little conceptual load

======= ======= ======= ======= ======= ======= ======= 

Previous cross reality systems addressed the vacancy problem by manifesting actions/events taht took place in one environment into the other, such that when you were 'participating' in one environment you could perceive actions/events happenning in the other. In addition, there were static interfaces at which you could visually observe the other environment.

Mirrorshades forgoes the manifestation of actions/events & instead focusses on visual observation of environments, by giving the user a mobile interface through which to observe both environments, switching between them easily & quickly.

Lifton's XR addressed the vacancy problem by 'linking the environments more closely' in 2 ways;
1.) by integration of sensor/actuator infrastructure into the environments
2.) by visual interfaces between the environments

MShades focusses on 2.), extending it by making the visual interface mobile as opposed to the static interfaces of Lifton's XR which were at fixed pre-determined locations.

Lifton's 'absence' is 'absence OF' a person, not a person who is feeling absent.
