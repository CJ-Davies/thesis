The design \& development of the Mirrorshades platform was driven both to investigate mobile PR systems as a concept in general \& to assess their suitability when applied to a particular case study as a new modality for interacting with virtual content within the context of a cultural heritage site. For this purpose evaluation of the platform firstly addressed its reception compared to a `traditional' virtual heritage experience \& secondly studied reactions \& preferences toward different PR implementations with regards to the default view \& transition styles provided.

\section{Overview}

The evaluation process was divided into two stages; the first assessed the utility of Mirrorshades as a mobile PR platform in comparison to existing VR techniques used within a virtual heritage context, while the second investigated participants' preferences \& reactions to different transition styles, in order to inform further PR implementations. A combination of qualitative \& quantitative data were collected for both stages, as the nature of the platform experience is such that purely quantitative data are not sufficient to gain an insight into the experiential aspect, but are nonetheless useful to corroborate, or rebut, qualitative responses \& observations.

Participants were sourced by adverts disseminated via an internal university memo system, which sends email to all registered staff \& students each week. The advert appeared for several consecutive weeks. Participants were invited to take part in a \textit{``virtual reality study \ldots\ investigating different ways of switching your view between your real surroundings \& a virtual environment''}. Participation was incentivised by a prize draw to win Amazon vouchers. This approach was adopted instead of sourcing participants from within the OVW group \& (computer science) department, as participants with a heightened knowledge \&/or interest in the technology underlying the platform were expected to skew results by paying conscious attention to the system \& its implementation rather than the actual experience of using the system. In total 17 participants, 10x male \& 7x female, with a mean age of 23.1 years \& a standard deviation of 4.9 years, took part in the user studies, each lasting 20-30 minutes. All studies took place at St Salvator's chapel during afternoon hours, with the chapel open to the general public.

\section{Stage 1 - PR for Virtual Heritage}

Previously when immersive VR has been employed in virtual heritage scenarios, it has predominantly been implemented as CAVE experiences~\cite{Roussou2002}. Visitors to a museum or visitor centre will be offered the opportunity to step into a CAVE, possibly donning shutter glasses or similar apparatus to enable a stereoscopic 3D effect, to experience a VR reconstruction of a location, its contents \& actors. Some of these CAVE installations have featured physical control interfaces such as joystick \& 3D mouse~\cite{cabral:x3dexperience} \& haptic interfaces~\cite{Christou2006}, while others have tracked user movement, whether head only or full body  gestures (such as in figure \ref{VTTP_projection.png}). In common among these CAVE experiences is the fact that the VR content they present is experienced with a disconnect to the RW site that it pertains to, as the CAVE itself immerses users in VR visuals \& does not permit them to see any of their RW surroundings, comparable to the experience of weareing a VR HMD without see-through video functionality. Furthermore, the physical size of the CAVE limits the amount in any particular direction that a user can physically move, even if movement is encouraged due to its use as a control methodology. This introduces both temporal \& spatial separation between a user's experiences of the VR content \& the corresponding RW environment.

With the promise of high performance VR HMDs at a consumer price point on the horizon, thanks largely to the rejuvenation in the field effected by Oculus, their use at cultural heritage sites for achieving similar experiences to previous CAVE installations is becoming more plausible \& brings with it certain benefits such as a reduction in the physical space required at the site for the installation. The OVW group's experience with presenting both experts \& interested amateurs, young \& old, with virtual heritage content via Oculus HMDs (both DK1 \& DK2, see section \ref{virtual-heritage-at-st-andrews}) has been very promising. These interactions have taken place in scenarios similar to those of existing CAVE scenarios; the user remains physically stationary \& uses a controller or gestures to move their virtual presence throughout the VR environment, whilst unable to observe their RW environment due to the nature of the HMD isolating them from RW visual stimuli.

In this first stage of the evaluation a comparison is made of this `traditional' style of interacting with VR content at a cultural heritage site wherein VR is experienced in isolation from RW, with both temporal \& spatial separation, against the `new' style afforded by the Mirrorshades PR platform, in which VR can be experienced in tandem with RW by allowing the user to move around their RW environment \& transition at any time into seeing the VR environment from the equivalent vantage point. Participants in this stage of the evaluation thus completed two scenarios wherein they interact with the RW St Salvator's chapel \& its corresponding VR reconstruction;

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Traditional scenario} - Participants experience the RW \& VR chapels separately. They navigate the VR chapel from a stationary position, as VR has traditionally been employed at cultural heritage sites via CAVE installations \& by the OVW group with Oculus HMDs, using the Xbox controller to move around the VR environment observed via the DK1, with the DK1 obscuring their view of the RW chapel around them. Subsequently, they navigate the RW chapel without the DK1 or any associated equipment.
	\item \textbf{PR scenario} - Participants experience the RW \& VR chapels in tandem using the Mirrorshades platform. They wear the DK1, holding the Xbox controller in their right hand \& the smartphone in their left, with the laptop \& control box bundle in a satchel worn over one shoulder. Pressing \& holding a button on the Xbox controller triggers a transition from RW visual stimuli to VR visual displayed by the DK1.
\end{enumerate}

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Design of the Scenarios}

The scenarios were intended to mimic the style of exploration \& interaction that visitors to the chapel display, after observing the behaviour of such visitors on several occasions. From these observations, a common pattern of behaviour emerged: visitors enter the chapel from the North/West corner then proceed to walk Eastwards along the nave, pausing to look around after passing through the rood screen, before continuing along the nave toward the altar. They then pause in front of the altar upon reaching the end of the pews \& then walk North toward the tomb where they pause again to inspect it. Participants in this first stage of the evaluation process were instructed to imagine that they were performing a similar visit to the chapel \& to follow a similar path, pausing after the rood screen, at the end of the pews \& in front of the tomb to look around their environment(s) in more detail, however they were encouraged to stop \& look around at any times/positions that they wished \& not to feel restricted to the described path \& locations - the intent of the scenario was to encourage a natural style of exploration despite the unusual situation of making use of bulky VR hardware, rather than to restrict them to an `on rails' experience. Participants were shown the map included as figure \ref{chapel-path} (North upwards) to help visualise the scenario.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{chapel-path.png}
		\caption{The path \& positions within the chapel that participants are instructed to attend to.}
		\label{chapel-path}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

In the traditional scenario participants interacted with the VR chapel using the DK1 \& Xbox controller while seated. After completing the path in the VR chapel, they removed the DK1 \& walked the same path in the RW chapel. This behaviour alludes to how VR has previously been applied to cultural heritage sites such as St Salvator's chapel, wherein visitors would have the opportunity to experience a CAVE or stationary HMD based reconstruction of the site either before or after having explored the RW site. In the PR scenario participants wore the DK1, held the Xbox controller in their right hand \& the smartphone in their left, with the laptop \& control box bundle in a satchel worn over a shoulder (see figures \ref{participant-f.png} \& \ref{participant-m.png}). They then walked the same path, but this time with the ability to transition at any time between viewing the RW chapel \& the VR chapel from the equivalent vantage point.

In the PR scenario, participants had access to a single transition style, the transition with linear interpolation (see section \ref{transition-with-linear-interpolation}), triggered by pressing \& holding the \texttt{A} button on the Xbox controller. As mentioned in section \ref{initial-testing}, this transition emerged as the `favourite' during initial tests within the OVW group. As such, it was chosen as the only transition style for the PR scenario in this first stage of evaluation wherein the focus of the investigation was upon comparing the PR scenario to the traditional scenario experience \& not upon gleaning details of the merits \& drawbacks exhibited by different PR implementations. The default view on the DK1's screen was 100\% RW with the transition causing a change to 100\% VR, a situation visualised upon the combined model in figure \ref{focus-locus-sensus-with-virtuality-continuum-with-transition}.

Before taking part in the two scenarios, participants were given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the DK1 by spending a few minutes interacting with Oculus' `Tuscany' demo\footnote{\url{https://share.oculus.com/app/oculus-tuscany-demo}}. This demo was developed by Oculus themselves \& is distributed with the Rift Unity integration package. It represented at the time a very polished \& stable DK1 experience, ideal for introducing inexperienced users to HMD based VR. It was thus used to give participants an opportunity to acclimatize to the Rift, in order to reduce skewing their subsequent experiences with the St Salvator's chapel model due to drastically different levels of familiarity with the DK1 between the two scenarios.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Evaluation Techniques}

The comparison of the traditional scenario against the PR scenario was facilitated by the collection of a variety of both qualitative \& quantitative data. All participants completed a pre-task questionnaire which provided calibration for latter data by enquiring about age, gender identity, previous experience with VR HMDs \& whether they had previously visited St Salvtor's chapel, both RW \& VR (the RW chapel is open to the public \& a version of the VR reconstruction is publicly accessible via the OVW group's OpenSim grid\footnote{\url{openvirtualworlds.org}}). The System Usability Scale (SUS)~\cite{Brooke1996} was used to provide a basic comparison between the usability of the two scenarios, while a 12-item Likert-type questionnaire (included as appendix \ref{appendix-12-item-likert-type-questionnaire-stage-1}) was used to collect opinions on more specific aspects of the experience of both scenarios. At the end of the session, after completing both scenarios, participants were engaged in a short structured interview (prompts included as appendix \ref{appendix-interview-questions-stage-1}) in order to allow them to elaborate upon their experience in a more free form manner. Finally, in addition to the DK1 visuals being recorded via ShadowPlay, log data were collected during both scenarios, capturing the information detailed in table \ref{logdatatable} to file for each frame rendered to the DK1's screen, for later processing \& visualising via R.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Hypotheses}
\label{stage1hypotheses}
This first stage of evaluation was designed to ascertain whether applying mobile PR to a cultural heritage scenario results in an improvement in participant engagement with \& understanding of the relationships between the RW \& VR environments, compared to a traditional virtual heritage scenario. Such improvements were expected to result from addressing the problems of spatial \& temporal separation inherent with the traditional scenario by imparting upon the participant the ability to transition at will between equivalent vantage points within the RW \& VR environments.

Overall participants were expected to report that the PR scenario did allow them to better compare \& contrast the RW \& VR environments, identify differences between the RW \& VR environments \& gain a better understanding of how the RW \& VR environments relate to each other. However it was also expected that some participants would report that having to `split' their attention between the two environments in the PR scenario led to lessened engagement \& understanding \& that the visual quality of the RW view through the cameras led to them preferring the traditional scenario.

It was expected that the cumbersome nature of the PR scenario in terms of the hardware that needed to be carried by the participant \& the reduced quality of viewing the RW environment via the cameras would have a noticeable effect upon participants' movement (both in terms of their position \& the orientation of their head) in the PR scenario compared to the VR section of the traditional scenario, most likely a restriction. The cumbersome nature of the hardware was also expected to impact SUS scores, with the PR scenario averaging lower than the traditional scenario. Participants who were able to overcome this cumbersomeness were expected to respond more favourably to the PR scenario than those who could not.

The 12-item Likert-type questionnaire was expected to reveal several distinctions. In particular;
\begin{itemize}
	\item Participants will find it easier to compare \& contrast RW \& VR environments in the PR scenario than in the traditional scenario (q2)
	\item Participants will experience a greater  sense of `being there' in the VR environment in the PR scenario than in the traditional scenario, due to physical movement/embodiment~\cite{Groten2011} (q4)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Furthermore, participants will have a greater sense of `being in the past' in the PR scenario than in the traditional scenario (q7)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Participants will maintain greater awareness of both RW \& VR environments in the PR scenario than in the traditional scenario (q5)
	\item Participants will gain a better understanding of what the chapel was like in the past in the PR scenario than in the traditional scenario (q12)
\end{itemize}

In addition to substantiating or refuting questionnaire results \& interview responses, the log data themselves were expected to provide insight into relationships between several aspects of the traditional \& PR scenarios, such as;
\begin{itemize}
	\item Head movement (pitch \& yaw) will be more restricted in the PR scenario compared to the VR section of the traditional scenario
	\item Participants will display an aversion to looking around (even at RW) when moving in the PR scenario
\end{itemize}

Interview transcripts were expected to lend support to the following assumptions;
\begin{itemize}
	\item the PR scenario makes it easier to spot differences between RW \& VR than the traditional scenario
	\item the PR scenario reveals differences that the traditional scenario didn't
	\item the traditional scenario does not reveal differences that the PR scenario didn't
	\item the PR scenario is preferred \& is user-reported as 'more engaging' than the traditional scenario
\end{itemize}

Assessing the severity of these issues through this first stage of evaluation is critical such that future PR implementations can be informed in order to allow them to achieve a quality of experience sufficient that participants do not feel that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits. For application of PR to virtual heritage to be a success, users must not feel restricted from performing transitions due to their jarring nature, or prefer a traditional virtual heritage experience due to the superior visual acuity of unmediated RW stimuli compared to mediated RW stimuli in the PR scenario.

%=========================================================================================================

\section{Stage 1 Results}

A total of 6 participants completed the stage 1 investigation;
\begin{itemize}
	\item Age ranged from 21 to 26, with a mean of 23.3 \& a standard deviation of 1.86
	\item 3x identified as male \& 3x as female
	\item All reported previous experience with a games console controller
	\item 1x reported previous experience with a HMD
	\item 2x reported having previously visited the chapel
	\item None had previously experienced the virtual chapel
\end{itemize}

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{SUS}
As expected, the PR scenario scored lower on SUS than the traditional scenario (see figure \ref{sus.png}), but not drastically so.

\TwoFig{1/sus.png}{SUS results for stage 1.}{sus.png}
       {1/post_task_questionnaire_boxplot.png}{Likert-type questionnaire results.}{post_task_questionnaire_boxplot.png}

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Likert-type Questionnaires}

One participant did not complete the Likert-type questionnaires. Coincidentally this participant was also the only one to have reported previous experience with a HMD in the pre-task questionnaire, so the Likert-type questionnaire responses wholly represent participants with no prior HMD experience. With the resurgence of interest in HMD based VR in recent years, the number of developers \& enthusiasts with HMD experience is climbing. However until the first commercial VR HMDs are released \& begin to permeate gaming \& media consumption audiences the situation captured by these questionnaire results, where all visitors to a cultural heritage site had no previous HMD experience, should be considered representative of the general public. When considering the responses to the Likert-type questionnaires (see figure \ref{post_task_questionnaire_boxplot.png}) for the first stage participants several observations can be made.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Participants enjoyed the PR scenario more than the traditional scenario (q1)
	\item Participants found it easier to compare features from past \& present in the PR scenario (q2)
	\item Perceived motion sickness/dizziness was not noticeably different between the two scenarios (q3)
	\item There was a greater sense of `being there' in the VR environment in the PR scenario (q4)
	\item There was a greater awareness of both environments in the PR scenario (q5)
	\item Participants found the PR scenario a more rewarding way to explore the chapel (q6)
	\item Participants had a greater sense of being in the past in the PR scenario (q7)
	\item Both scenarios scored fairly low for participants thinking they would have preferred a conventional monitor (q8)
	\item The PR scenario changed participants’ understanding of the chapel more than the traditional scenario (q9)
	\item Both scenarios scored equally low for participants’ thinking they did not notice differences between RW \& VR (q10)
	\item The visual quality of the headset was perceived as being worse in the mobile scenario (q11). Whilst the visual quality of the VR visuals was identical in both scenarios, this result is presumably because during the PR scenario the participants were viewing the RW environment upon the DK1's screen via the cameras, with much lower visual acuity than in the traditional scenario where they observed the RW environment unmediated.
	\item Participants felt that they better understood what the chapel was like in the past after the PR scenario, compared to the traditional scenario (q12)
\end{itemize}

These results largely confirm the hypotheses from section \ref{stage1hypotheses}. It is also worth noting that although the PR scenario scored lower than the traditional scenario in SUS, both scenarios scored highly in question 2 (\textit{``It was easy to compare features from the past \& the present''}) \& low in question 8 (\textit{``I would have preferred a conventional computer monitor''}).

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Interview Transcripts}

Studying the structured interviews that took place after participants had completed both scenarios (interviews were recorded \& subsequently transcribed) provided a wealth of qualitative feedback about the stage 1 investigation.

All participants said that the PR scenario was (much) more engaging than the traditional scenario, even though 2x participants said that they preferred the traditional scenario. Of those that said they preferred the traditional scenario, one did not find it comfortable to walk while wearing the DK1 \& the other reported gaining a better understanding of the past from the traditional scenario. The participant who found it uncomfortable to walk while wearing the DK1 was notably taller than all of the other participants in this stage. This is worth mentioning as the `height' of the virtual cameras in the VR reconstruction was fixed with reference to the UK average height of 5 feet 9 inches \& was not changed to account for different participant heights, as this would have required a lengthy calibration phase for each \& every participant. Thus for a participant of average height, the discrepancy between their RW viewpoint \& their VR viewpoint was minimal, however for a particularly short or tall participant this discrepancy would have been much worse \& may have contributed to the discomfort of walking with the DK1 as each transition between RW \& VR would have resulted in a perceptible shift in height. Those that said that they preferred the PR scenario alluded to the immediacy of comparison between RW \& VR afforded by it as a contributing factor.

Twice as many participants reported that the PR scenario made it easier to spot differences between RW \& VR as reported that the traditional scenario made it easier, with 4 out of 6 participants reporting noticing differences between RW \& VR in the PR scenario that they did not notice in the traditional scenario. In particular, the different position of the rood screen was mentioned by several participants \& one participant was able to list multiple differences that s/he had spotted in the PR scenario that they had not noticed in the traditional scenario. One participant directly mentioned then confirmed that immediacy of comparison between RW \& VR was the enabler of spotting more differences, another mentioned that with the traditional scenario it was not clear that you were \textit{``trying to look into the past''} but in the PR scenario it was obvious because \textit{``you can see the differences''}, while another directly said that s/he preferred the PR scenario because \textit{``it was easier to compare \& contrast between the real world \& the virtual one''}.

The quality of the cameras was mentioned as a possible detractor by one of the participants who answered that the traditional scenario made it easier to spot differences between RW \& VR, with another participant specifically mentioning that a higher \textit{``resolution''} was needed.

The one participant to report experiencing motion sickness elaborated that it was worse when using the DK1 in the traditional scenario than when walking with the DK1 in the PR scenario, because \textit{``sitting down \& moving around feels weird''} (a reference to moving throughout the VR environment using the Xbox controller whilst physically stationary sitting on a chair). This observation alludes to the idea of physical embodiment/movement improving a VR experience, by demonstrating the opposite position of restricted movement \& a lack of matching embodiment worsening the VR experience.

With regards to movement in the PR scenario, the accuracy \& especially the lag of the indoor positioning was cited by one participant as needing work, because it \textit{``caught me off guard twice''}. From watching the ShadowPlay recorded videos from the PR scenario, it is clear that in many cases the participants would trigger a transition to VR visual stimuli only to find that their VR position had not yet `caught up' with their RW position.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Log Data}

For the traditional scenario log data were recorded while each participant was engaging with the VR chapel, in a seated position \& using the Xbox controller to navigate the VR environment. For the PR scenario log data were recorded throughout the whole scenario, such that data are available for both the periods in which participants were observing the RW chapel via the DK1 \& cameras in addition to the periods in which participants were observing the VR chapel. As such, several comparisons can be made between these data. Within the PR scenario, comparisons can be made between the periods that participants were observing RW \& the periods that participants were observing VR. Between the traditional scenario \& the PR scenario, comparisons can be made between the VR section of the traditional scenario \& the periods that participants were observing VR in the PR scenario. Log data were not captured for participant 2, nor were they captured for the traditional scenario for participant 5.

\subsubsection{Comparing traditional \& PR scenarios}

When looking at either scenario's data (the VR section of the traditional scenario \& both RW \& VR periods of the PR scenario) it is immediately evident that participants looked to their sides \& turned their heads horizontally (yaw) far more than they looked above \& beneath themselves by tilting their heads vertically (pitch). This relationship is shown in figures \ref{1_pitch_yaw_2up.png}, \ref{4_pitch_yaw_2up.png} \& \ref{6_pitch_yaw_2up.png}, which show pitch \& yaw plotted against time for both the traditional scenario \& the PR scenario, for participants 1, 4 \& 6 respectively. With the traditional scenario on the left of each pair of plots \& the PR scenario on the right, the displacement of the blue line representing yaw is substantially greater in both than the displacement of the red line representing yaw.

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{1/1_pitch_yaw_2up.png}
	\caption{Pitch \& yaw against time for participant 1 in traditional \& PR scenarios.}
	\label{1_pitch_yaw_2up.png}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

	\caption{Pitch \& yaw against time for participant 6 in traditional \& PR scenarios.}
	\label{6_pitch_yaw_2up.png}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

This relationship is reflected calculating the standard deviation in pitch \& yaw across both scenarios, shown by table \ref{sdpitchyawtrad} for the traditional scenario \& table \ref{sdpitchyawpr} for the PR scenario. For every participant for which the data are available, the standard deviation in yaw is substantially higher than that in pitch. This relationship can largely be explained by the simple fact that there is more to observe in the chapel(s) at ground level than above eye level or upon the ground, however with the marked difference in the appearance of the chapel roof (stone in the VR reconstruction, wood in the RW chapel today) a smaller difference between pitch \& yaw variance might have been expected for both scenarios.

%=====================

When studying plots of head pitch \& yaw against time aligned with plots of distance moved against time, some participants display an aversion to large head movements while moving. Considering participant 1 (figure \ref{1_4up.png}), they seem to have been quite comfortable looking around a lot even while moving in the traditional scenario, while in the PR scenario their large head movements are close to the periods in which their position was not changing as much\footnote{When looking at these plots it is important to appreciate that lag in the IndoorAtlas data results in a small lateral offset between the position data \& the head orientation data, as the latter is unaffected by the lag in the correct reporting \& `settling' of the former.}. When looking at the same data plotted for participant 3 however (figure \ref{3_4up.png}), it seems that they were reluctant to perform large head movements while moving in both scenarios, rather than just the PR scenario.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Reluctance to changing head orientation when moving in the traditional scenario can be explained by something as simple as participant 1 having more experience with video games that present the user with a `first person' perspective in which movement \& looking direction are controlled independently. For somebody familiar with this style of control, it is second nature to use one control to change their position whilst simultaneously using another control to change the direction in which they are looking, however for those unfamiliar or inexperienced with such scenarios it is common to observe alternation between movement \& looking, something that the OVW group has observed in people interacting with our content at various demonstrations using keyboard \& mouse, Xbox controller \& other control methodologies. For first person shooter (FPS) video games, this is commonly achieved by using keyboard buttons to control movement while using a mouse to control looking direction. With the traditional scenario, the Xbox controller provides control over movement while the head tracker in the DK1 provides control over looking direction by tracking head orientation.

Reluctance to changing head orientation when moving in the PR scenario is most logically explained by participants feeling as though with the reduced visual acuity of their RW environment \& the discrepancy in position \& environmental objects of their VR environment that they needed to pay more conscious attention to their walking.

\subsubsection{Comparing RW \& VR periods within PR scenario}

When comparing pitch \& yaw data between the RW \& VR periods within the PR scenario, it is notable that for some participants there was more variance in the periods in which they were perceiving VR stimuli than in those in which they were perceiving RW stimuli, meaning that they turned their head more when looking at the VR environment than when looking at the RW environment. This is particularly evident when plotting these pitch \& yaw data against time with the RW/VR visuals indicated. Figure \ref{1_pitch_yaw.png} shows the pitch \& yaw data for participant 1 during the PR scenario, who prominently displayed this tendency toward greater head movement while viewing VR than RW. The coloured background of the plot indicates which environment the participant was perceiving at that time index; blue for RW \& green for VR. There is evident correlation to be seen between the most pronounced changes in yaw (red line) \& the periods that the participant was observing VR stimuli (green background).

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{1/1_pitch_yaw.png}
	\caption{Pitch \& yaw against time for participant 1 in PR scenario, showing RW/VR periods.}
	\label{1_pitch_yaw.png}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in figure \ref{3_pitch_yaw.png} this relationship is even more prevalent in the data from participant 3, while the data from participant 5 in figure \ref{5_pitch_yaw.png} still show the relationship but to a lesser extent.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{1/3_pitch_yaw.png}
	\caption{Pitch \& yaw against time for participant 3 in PR scenario, showing RW/VR periods.}
	\label{3_pitch_yaw.png}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{1/5_pitch_yaw.png}
	\caption{Pitch \& yaw against time for participant 5 in PR scenario, showing RW/VR periods.}
	\label{5_pitch_yaw.png}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Calculating the mean standard deviation in yaw for both RW \& VR periods, weighted by the duration of the periods, shows this relationship more accurately. With reference to the figures in table \ref{sdyawtab} the mean standard deviation in yaw while perceiving VR stimuli is higher than while perceiving RW stimuli for participant 1 (39.887\textdegree\ compared to 25.545\textdegree) \& even more so for participant 3 (60.636\textdegree\ compared to 11.702\textdegree). The values are closer for participant 5, due to the initial large delta in yaw just before the first transition into VR at around 130 seconds. Recalculating the weighted mean standard deviation from 150 seconds onwards to exclude this peak gives rise to the values of 36.074\textdegree\ for VR stimuli compared to 17.046\textdegree\ for RW stimuli, which is more in fitting with the impressions drawn from studying figure \ref{5_pitch_yaw.png}. The exception to this observation is participant 4, however this participant displayed very restricted head movement throughout both scenarios when compared to the other participants.

\caption{Weighted mean sd in yaw for PR scenario.}
\label{sdyawtab}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Also, when considering the amount of time spent perceiving each environment in the PR scenario, several of the participants showed frequent transitioning behaviour, where they would perform many transitions \& remain perceiving the visual stimuli from each environment for only a few seconds: for participants 1, 4 \& 6, the mean times for both RW \& VR periods are all between 1.68 \& 3.4 seconds. Participant 3 spent longer perceiving each environment with a RW mean of 18.2 seconds \& a VR mean of 7 seconds. The outlier is participant 5, with a RW mean of 31.8 seconds \& a VR mean of 3.6 seconds; this was the participant who found it uncomfortable to walk while wearing the DK1, so a much longer amount of time spent perceiving RW stimuli is understandable.

\subsubsection{Comparing VR periods of PR scenario to VR section of traditional scenario}

Furthermore, comparing yaw from the VR periods of the PR scenario (table \ref{sdyawtab}) against yaw from the traditional scenario (table \ref{sdpitchyawtrad}) it can be seen that in most cases there is a noticeably less yaw change in the VR periods of the PR scenario than in the traditional scenario, leading to the conclusion that participants felt more comfortable to perform larger head movements when seated with the DK1 than when standing/walking with the DK1. Observations of participants while they performed the traditional scenario support this with several participants twisting their heads right around to look behind them without changing their direction of their virtual `movement', while when walking in the PR scenario they tended to largely look ahead \& perform larger orientation changes by instead turning their whole body to begin walking in the return direction.

Further comparing head movements between the VR section of the traditional scenario \& the VR periods of the PR scenario, the difference between the magnitude of pitch \& yaw is greater in the VR section of the traditional scenario than in the VR periods of the PR scenario. Comparing these values from tables \ref{sdpitchyawtrad}, \ref{sdpitchyawpr} \& \ref{sdpitchyawtrad} this difference exhibits as smaller variance in yaw \& roughly unchanged (only slight increased) variance in pitch for the VR periods of the PR scenario, further indicating that participants were more comfortable to look around themselves more freely in the traditional scenario than the PR scenario, leading to less overall head movement in the PR scenario than the traditional scenario.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Summary}

In general, participant reactions to the Mirrorshades platform met the hypotheses. From the questionnaire data \& interview transcripts, participants reported that they found the PR scenario to be both more enjoyable \& more rewarding than the traditional scenario, despite the decreased usability \& comfort effected by the requirement to don \& carry a satchel of hardware \& hold devices in both hands. The PR scenario was reported as allowing easier comparison \& contrast between RW \& VR environments, leading to recognising more differences between the two environments \& a greater change in \& better understanding of the chapel than with the traditional scenario. The visual acuity afforded by the cameras \& both the accuracy \& lag of the IPS surfaced as the major detractors to the experience of the PR scenario.

From the log data, participants displayed restricted head movement throughout the PR scenario, looking to their sides \& above \& beneath themselves less when experiencing the VR chapel in the PR scenario than when experiencing the VR chapel in the traditional scenario. While this restriction does not appear to have been so great that it reduced the utility \& enjoyability of the PR scenario to beneath that of the traditional scenario, it has been observed by other researchers~\cite{Slater1998} that there is a significant positive association between reported sense of presence in a VR environment \& the amount of body movement, particularly head yaw, displayed by a participant, so reducing the negative impact that a PR system has upon a user's willingness to freely look around them will likely result in beneficial returns, especially when considering that restricted head movement may lead to overlooking interesting aspects of the environments.

Through this first stage of evaluation the Mirrorshades platform has shown itself to be a rewarding new modality for experiencing VR content in a cultural heritage context, improving upon traditional techniques employed for the presentation of such content by allowing immediate comparison \& contrast between corresponding vantage points in both the RW \& VR environments.

\section{Stage 2 - Informing PR Implementation}

The first stage of evaluation into the Mirrorshades platform led to the conclusion that applying a mobile PR system to a cultural heritage scenario provides an experience that is more enjoyable \& engaging than a traditional virtual heritage scenario making use of immersive VR presentation via CAVE or static HMD, while also leading participants to a greater understanding of the relationships between the RW \& VR content presented to them. While certain drawbacks in the system highlighted by the first stage of evaluation, such as the visual acuity of the video see-through solution \& the lag in the IPS, could not be iterated upon due to lack of suitable technology, other aspects of the system that affect the overall PR experience could be investigated - namely the way that transitions between RW \& VR visual stimuli are performed, including whether the default view is 100\% RW or a mix of RW \& VR, as participants in stage 1 of the evaluation were furnished with only a single style of transition.

Stage 2 of the evaluation was divided into two parts. In the first (stage 2.1), evaluation focussed upon assessing participants' reactions to \& preferences toward three different transition styles, while in the second (stage 2.2), evaluation looked at reactions \& preferences in response to two different default views comprising RW/VR mixes. In terms of the combined Milgram/Waterworh model, this second stage of evaluation pertains to assessing the effect upon participants' focus of attention (\& to a lesser extent, sensus of attention) when performing oscillations along the locus axis using different techniques. Stage 2.1 investigates oscillations where the default view is 100\% RW, with participants performing oscillations between the RW extreme of the locus of attention axis \& other points upon the locus axis (such as in figure \ref{transition-rw-vr-hard.png}), while stage 2.2 looks into oscillations where the default view is a mix of RW \& VR, limiting how far toward the RW extreme of the locus axis the participant can reach (such as in figure \ref{transition-mix-vr.png}).

While stage 1 of the evaluation investigated the suitability of applying a mobile PR platform to the particular use case of virtual heritage, stage 2, while still within the same virtual heritage scenario, has wider use for informing implementation of PR systems in general \& not just within the context of virtual heritage.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Evaluation Techniques}

As with the stage 1 investigation, a range of both qualitative \& quantitative data were collected. Evaluating participants' preferences toward different styles of transitioning between RW \& VR visual stimuli pertains to studying their reactions \& responses to ascertain the effect upon their focus of attention, a concept that is largely psychological in nature \& highly subjective~\cite{Ijsselsteijn2001}. Thus, subjective measures will produce the bulk of the data for evaluation, however they will again be backed up by objective log data to support or contradict any relationships that emerge.

Stage 2 participants completed the same pre-task questionnaire as the stage 1 participants \& Likert-type questionnaires that shared certain items with that from stage 1 were also used; the stage 2.1 participants completed a 12-item questionnaire (included as appendix \ref{appendix-12-item-likert-type-questionnaire-stage-2-1}), while stage 2.2 participants completed a 9-item questionnaire (included as appendix \ref{appendix-9-item-likert-type-questionnaire-stage-2-2}). The SUS questionnaire was not used, while post-task interviews (prompts included as appendices \ref{appendix-interview-questions-stage-2-1} \& \ref{appendix-interview-questions-stage-2-2} for stage 2.1 \& stage 2.2 respectively) \& logging were present. In addition to the Likert-type questionnaire, all stage 2 participants also completed the igroup presence questionnaire~\cite{Schubert2001} (IPQ, included as appendix \ref{appendix-igroup-presence-questionnaire}).

As presence does not have a single widely agreed upon definition \& those definitions that are commonly used, including that adopted by this thesis of \textit{the experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another} (see section \ref{lit-review-presencec}), are subjective in nature, attempts to quantify or `measure' the experience of presence are met with difficulty \& many different approaches have been adopted, some more or less suitable to certain scenarios than others. Broadly, these approaches can be categorised as either subjective (most commonly post task questionnaires), behavioural (measurement/observation of actions that do not stem from conscious thought) or physiological (heart rate, skin conductance, etc.)~\cite{Insko2003}.

In this categorisation system, one could consider the log data recorded by the Mirrorshades platform to provide a behavioural insight into the participants' sense of presence \& the interview \& Likert-type questionnaires to provide a subjective insight. For this second stage of evaluation where direct comparison is made between different styles of transition in hopes of ascertaining which result in less pronounced breaks in presence, the use of an established presence questionnaire was deemed a prudent addition to the evaluation techniques to inquire more directly about the sense of presence than the other evaluation techniques.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Presence Questionnaires}

Due to the nature of the Mirrorshades platform most established presence questionnaires could not be directly applied,  for they are predominantly written for application to `traditional' VR scenarios in which the user is immersed in a VR (or remote, in the case of telepresence) environment at the intentional exclusion of stimuli from their RW environment. Illustrated in reference to an embodied cognition framework, the sense of presence in such a scenario is argued to develop from the construction of a spatial-functional mental model of the VR environment, through a combination of representation of bodily actions as possible in the VR environment \& suppression of incompatible sensory input from the RW environment~\cite{Schubert2001}. However considering a PR scenario within the same framework, sensory input from a RW environment that features high spatial equivalence with the VR environment is not incompatible; in fact it should be considered complimentary. Whereas a traditional VR experience attempts to create in the user's mind a new spatial-functional model that exists separate to, incompatible with \& suppressing the model of their RW surroundings, PR systems should instead be considered as enhancing the user's existing model of their RW surroundings, or alternatively as creating a complementary model that sits parallel to it \& can be attended to in tandem.

This distinction is perhaps best explained as a difference in the use of the term `presence', which can be visualised using the combined Milgram/Waterworth model. Established presence questionnaires assess presence in terms of the user's position upon the locus of attention axis, where `a sense of presence' means a position toward the VR extreme of the axis \& `no sense of presence' means a position toward the RW extreme of the axis. In this stage of the evaluation into the Mirrorshades PR platform however, the aim of the evaluation is to assess presence in terms of the user's position upon the focus of attention axis, to assess the severity of breaks in presence defined as deflections upon the focus of attention axis from the presence extreme in the direction of the absence extreme, representing increased cognitive load caused by performing a transition between two environments. Instead of assessing allocation of locus of attention between two \textit{incompatible} sets of environmental stimuli, this stage of evaluation hoped to assess the impact that a locus of attention oscillating between \textit{complimentary} sets of environmental stimuli has upon the participant's focus of attention.

Many established presence questionnaires that feature wording \& weighting of questions associating negativity to awareness of the stimuli from the RW environment are thus unsuitable for use in assessment of a PR scenario. Whilst this approach is ideal for a traditional VR scenario in which immersion in a VR environment at the complete exclusion of the user's RW environment is the ultimate goal, it does not apply well to a PR scenario in which the ultimate goal is to imbue the user with the ability (\& desire) to transition between both RW \& VR environments, wherein maintaining an awareness of one environment while perceiving stimuli from the other is likely beneficial, rather than detrimental, to the overall experience.

For example, Witmer \& Singer's presence questionnaire~\cite{Witmer1998} poses several questions that directly enquire about aspects of the virtual environment (such as \textit{``13. How involved were you in the virtual environment experience?''}) but poses no questions that pertain to the RW environment other than a single comparison between VR \& RW (\textit{``7. How much did your experiences in the virtual environment seem consistent with your real world experiences?''}, an assessment touching on perceived realism \& of how well bodily actions were represented as possible in the VR environment). Other questionnaires, such as that used in an experiment by Slater \& Steed in which participants walked through a VR field of trees~\cite{Slater1998}, are less extreme in their weighting toward questions only about VR, asking questions both directly about the VR environment (\textit{``Please rate your sense of being in the field among the plants''}) but also enquiring as to the sense of being in the RW environment with a neutral tone (\textit{``During the time of the experience, which was strongest on the whole, your sense of being in the virtual field, or of being in the real world of the laboratory?''}). However even this still permeates an `either or' implication to the two environments, emphasising their incompatibility \& separateness.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{The Igroup Presence Questionnaire}
\label{igroup-presence-questionnaire-explanation}
The IPQ assesses presence based upon three factors; spatial presence (SP), involvement (INV) \& realness (REAL). While SP questions assess how much bodily actions are represented as possible in the VR environment \& REAL questions assess the `realness' of the VR environment by eliciting direct comparisons with the RW environment, INV questions assess suppression of incompatible sensory input from the RW environment but are not worded in a manner that presents attention paid to this sensory input as inherently negative (or even such that these stimuli are considered incompatible), reducing risk of negative bias when the questionnaire is applied to a scenario in which attention paid to RW stimuli is encouraged.

For a well implemented traditional VR experience that elicits a high sense of (virtual) presence in the user, one would expect their IPQ results to score highly in all three factors. As discussed by Constantin~\cite{Constantin2003a}, SP3 (\textit{``I did not feel present in the virtual space''}, anchored between \textit{``did not feel''} \& \textit{``felt present''}) \& INV2 (\textit{``I was not aware of my real environment''}, anchored between \textit{``fully disagree''} \& \textit{``fully agree''}) would seem to be fairly directly tied together, as a high involvement in the RW environment would intuitively reduce spatial presence by hampering the sense that bodily actions are possible in the VR environment.

However, in a PR scenario that features high spatial equivalence between its constituent RW \& VR environments, this tie between SP \& INV may not demonstrate. Due to the spatial equivalence between the two environments, bodily actions in the VR environment are inherently compatible with those in the RW environment, so SP may score highly even when INV scores low, as RW sensory input isn't suppressed but in fact encouraged. In fact, it may even be the case that an inverse relationship presents between SP3 \& INV2, as heightened awareness of the RW environment leads the user to a more believable representation of bodily actions in the VR environment as possible, increasing SP as (inherently possible) RW bodily actions are shared (`possible') with the VR environment. A restrained expectation would be for a PR scenario to present in general lower INV scores than the traditional scenario but without drastically reducing SP scores, whilst a more optimistic expectation would be for lower INV scores \& \textit{heightened} SP scores - that reinforcement of bodily actions within the RW environment will lead to an increase in experienced spatial presence in the VR environment.

\section{Stage 2.1}

Stage 2.1 followed a similar pattern to the stage 1 evaluation. Participants first received a `traditional' VR experience by using the DK1 \& Xbox controller to explore the VR chapel while seated \& subsequently completed the IPQ in order to produce baseline IPQ results for a traditional experience of the chapel model viewed via the DK1. Participants then performed two PR scenarios in which they walked through the RW/VR chapels, thus completing three scenarios in total.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Traditional scenario} - Participants explore the VR chapel from a stationary position, as VR has traditionally been employed at cultural heritage sites via CAVE installations \& by the OVW group with Oculus HMDs, using the Xbox controller to move around the VR environment observed via the DK1, with the DK1 obscuring theier view of the RW chapel around them.
	\item \textbf{PR scenario with transitions 1-3} - Participants experience the RW \& VR chapels in tandem using the Mirrorshades platform. They wear the DK1, holding the Xbox controller in their right hand \& the smartphone in their left, with the laptop \& control box bundle in a satchel worn over one shoulder. The default view on the DK1 screen is 100\% RW \& participants are granted access to 3x different transition styles;
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item hard switch (see section \ref{sub-hardswitch}) mapped to controller \texttt{[A]} button (transition 1)
		\item transition with linear interpolation (see section \ref{transition-with-linear-interpolation}) mapped to controller \texttt{[B]} button (transition 2)
		\item analogue selectable opacity (see section \ref{analogue-selectable-opacity}) mapped to controller right trigger \texttt{[RT]} (transition 3)
\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{PR scenario with transitions 1-4} - Participants experience the same scenario as scenario 3, however this time with the introduction of the periodic hard switch (see section \ref{subsub-periodic}) which triggers a 0.15 second transition to 100\% VR every 3 seconds unless interrupted by manually triggered transitions.
\end{enumerate}

In the PR scenario with transitions 1-3 pressing \& holding the \texttt{[A]} button triggered a hard switch from 100\% RW to 100\% VR, pressing \& holding the \texttt{[B]} button triggered a linear interpolated switch from 100\% RW to 100\% VR \& pulling on the right trigger \texttt{[RT]} reduced the opacity of the game objects upon which the camera feeds were rendered from 100\% to an amount that mapped to the amount that the trigger was pulled (pulling the trigger all the way in would reduce the opacity of the objects to 0\% \& thus display 100\% VR, pulling the trigger 33\% would reduce the opacity of the objects by 33\% \& thus display 66\% RW \& 33\% VR, etc.). In the PR scenario with transitions 1-4 participants were granted access to the same 3x transitions via the Xbox controller \& additionally the 4th transition of the periodic hard switch was triggered every 3 seconds for a duration of 0.15 seconds. These two scenarios are referred to as `scenario 1-3' \& `scenario 1-4', respectively.

Rather than describing a path through the chapel with particular positions of interest to stop \& look around at, participants were simply told to slowly make their way from the starting position down to the altar end of the chapel. For at least one participant in the stage 1 evaluation, their exploration of the environments seemed to be subdued by their adherence to the prescribed route. In order to promote a more natural style of exploration the route description was not used in the second stage of evaluation.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Hypotheses}

correlation between which type of transition participants favoured \& the situation they were in (walking, standing still, etc.)

It is hypothesized that a manner of transitioning between visual stimuli which results in a less severe BIP will be preferable to a manner of transitioning which results in a worse BIP. As focus in the Waterworth model is most closely related to presence in the VR literature~\cite{Waterworth2001}, one of the subjective measures that will be used in this evaluation will be an established presence measure, to try to capture the behaviour of the user's position upon the focus axis.

These data are expected to reveal relationships between various different metrics \& the choice of transition methods. For example, it is expected that participants will perform short transitions to VR or transitions to a mix of RW \& VR when moving \& perform longer transitions to VR when stationary. This kind of relationship will support or contradict the subjective data collected through questionnaire \& interview.

%=========================================================================================================

\section{Stage 2.1 Results}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Age ranged from 18 to 27, with a mean of 22.3 \& a standard deviation of 4
	\item 5x identified as male \& 2x as female
	\item All reported previous experience with a games console controller
	\item None reported previous experience with a HMD
	\item 2x reported having previously visited the chapel
	\item None reported having previously experienced the virtual chapel
\end{itemize}

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Likert-type Questionnaires}

When considering the responses to the Likert-type questionnaires (see figure \ref{2-1-12-item-likert-type-questionnaire-boxplot.png}) for the two PR scenarios of the stage 2.1 evaluation, the following observations can be made.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Participants found the scenario 1-3 more enjoyable than scenario 1-4 (q1)
	\item Preference toward one transition style over others was more varied \& in general less in scenario 1-3 than in scenario 1-4 (q2)
	\item Participants were more aware of both environments in scenario 1-4 than in scenario 1-3 (q3)
	\item Participants found it easier to compare features from past \& present in scenario 1-4 than in scenario 1-3 (q4)
	\item Participants preferred to use one transition more than others in certain situations more in scenario 1-4 than they did in scenario 1-3 (q5)
	\item Slightly more motion sickness was reported in scenario 1-4 (q7)
	\item Participants found scenario 1-3 to be a more rewarding way to explore the chapel (q8)
	\item Participants found that scenario 1-4 gave them a better understanding of what the chapel was like in the past (q10)
	\item Participants found switching between RW \& VR more uncomfortable in scenario 1-4 than in scenario 1-3 (q11)
	\item Participants reported not noticing differences slightly more in scenario 1-3 than in scenario 1-4
\end{itemize}

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Interview Transcripts}

Once again, recordings of the structured interviews were transcribed after the chapel sessions \& provided a wealth of qualitative insight into the participants' experiences with the Mirrorshades platform during the stage 2.1 evaluation.

Every single participant said that they preferred scenario 1-3 over scenario 1-4. In particular, one participant  reported that each time scenario 1-4 triggered an automatic transition (transition 4), s/he had to stop to regain their bearings, with another reporting that each transition 4 meant having to \textit{``stop \& work it out again''}. Several participants noted that they felt more `in control' during scenario 1-3 than during scenario 1-4. Transition 4 was reported as being particularly off-putting when inaccuracy in the IPS had placed the virtual vantage at a position notably different to the participant's real position, especially when this resulted in virtual \& real positions being on opposite sides of a wall.

Roughly half of the participants said that scenario 1-3 was more engaging, another found the scenarios roughly similar with regards to engagement \& 2x found scenario 1-4 to be more engaging although they mentioned that they suspected this could simply have been down to increased familiarity with the system. Several participants said that transition 4 was `unexpected', leading to a less `consistent' experience.

Responses were mixed when asked about whether one scenario allowed them to perceive more differences between RW \& VR in one scenario compared to the other. 3x reported experiencing no difference between the scenarios in this regard. 2x answered that they found scenario 1-3 better, one because the flash threw him/her off, the other because \textit{``you could fade between''}  although this feature (transition 3) was available in both scenarios. 2x chose 1-4 as better, one because transition 4 would happen when s/he wasn't prepared for a transition \& thus s/he would \textit{``notice that something had moved, whereas if I knew I was switching I would maybe subconsciously expecting things to move''}.

All but one participant reported preferring transition 3 accessed via the right trigger \texttt{[RT]} to the other transitions. The one participant who answered otherwise elaborated that they did not notice much difference between the different transition styles \& when thinking back to the scenarios was \textit{``not sure which one I was using now!''}. Looking at the log data for this participant however (see section \ref{2-1-log-data}) this participant did nonetheless make use of all the transition styles in both scenarios 1-3 \& 1-4, heavily favouring the hard switch transition 1 in scenario 1-4.

When asked why they preferred transition 3, participants reported liking how being able to control the opacity allowed them to \textit{``see elements of both''} environments at once, to \textit{``simultaneosuly measure the historical differences''}, with the trigger giving them more `control'.

Responses when asked about motion sickness varied greatly. One participant reported none at all in either scenario, while one reported some motion sickness when seated \& using the analogue stick of the Xbox controller to turn their virtual presence \& also when walking in the PR scenario when the IPS was inaccurate. One participant reported motion sickness that increased with time, being comfortable for the first 2/3rds of each scenario \& with both PR scenarios being worse than the traditional seated scenario. Three participants reported motion sickness only when walking in the PR scenarios; of these, one reported that it was worse in scenario 1-4 \& another said that motion sickness only occurred when looking at RW via the cameras. One participant only experienced motion sickness after removing the DK1.

Other comments included not knowing where they were in the chapel inducing motion sickness \& that accuracy of the IPS needed improvement, with sudden large VR movements inducing motion sickness. Furthermore, one participant commented directly upon the relationship between `immersion' \& perceived realism of the VR environment - \textit{``\ldots obviously it wasn't the same quality, but I still felt so immersed in it. Even though part of me would've known it wasn't real, most of it felt real even though it didn't look like it''}.

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Log Data}
\label{2-1-log-data}

Log data were recorded during all scenarios, however these data were not recorded for 4 out of the 7 participants for the traditional seated scenario thus detailed comparisons cannot reasonably be made between the traditional scenario \& the PR scenarios. Log data were however successfully recorded for both PR scenarios \& as such comparisons can be made between the PR scenarios \& within each PR scenarios.

%=====================

\subsubsection{Considering all scenarios (traditional \& PR)}

For all participants there was again substantially more yaw change than pitch change, in both traditional \& PR scenarios. Figure \ref{2-1-8-pitch-yaw-trad-1-3-1-4.png} shows this relationship by plotting pitch \& yaw against time for participant 8 for all three scenarios (traditional at left, scenario 1-3 in the middle \& scenario 1-4 at right) \& the standard deviations for pitch \& yaw for all participants across all three scenarios is given by tables \ref{2-1-sd-trad}, \ref{2-1-sd-1-3} \& \ref{2-1-sd-1-4}.

\subsubsection{Comparing RW \& VR periods within PR scenarios}

When comparing pitch \& yaw data between the RW \& VR periods within the two PR scenarios, five out of the seven participants displayed greater variance in yaw when perceiving VR stimuli than when perceiving RW stimuli for both scenario 1-3 \& scenario 1-4. Figure \ref{8-1-3-pitch-yaw.png} illustrates this relationship for participant 8 undertaking scenario 1-3 while figure \ref{12-1-4-pitch-yaw.png} illustrates the relationship for participant 12 undertaking scenario 1-4. Again the background colouring of the plots represents whether the participant was perceiving RW or VR visual stimuli at a particular time index, using different colours to indicate which transition style was used; pink for transition 1, green for transition 2, yellow for transition 3 \& dark blue for transition 4.

\end{figure}

When comparing head movement as mean standard deviation weighted by duration of the periods (tables \ref{mean-sd-yaw-1-3} \& \ref{mean-sd-yaw-1-4}) between the RW \& VR portions of the two PR scenarios, this relationship is seen much more substantially in scenario 1-4. Part of this is due to the fact that all participants in scenario 1-4 showed less change in yaw in the RW periods than in the RW periods of scenario 1-3. Whilst this apparent increased comfort with larger head movements in VR in scenario 1-4 could be explained due to familiarity, the magnitude of the difference between scenario 1-3 \& scenario 1-4 makes it hard to believe that familiarity is the sole reason, especially considering that scenario 1-4 was not a drastically different experience to scenario 1-3 as only the addition of transition 4 differentiated it from scenario 1-3.

\subsubsection{Experimenting With Transition Styles}

Some participants showed an understandable behaviour where they `tried out' the different transition styles before adopting one that they then used predominantly throughout the rest of the scenario. Participant 11 showed this behaviour in its most extreme case during scenario 1-3, when s/he tried each transition style once at the very beginning of the scenario \& then only used transition 3 (via the right trigger \texttt{[RT]}) throughout the rest of the scenario (figure \ref{11-pitch-yaw-1-3.png}). However when s/he came to perform scenario 1-4, s/he seemed to take this opportunity as a second chance to experiment with all of the different transition styles, using transitions 1, 2 \& 3 at different points throughout the scenario (figure \ref{11-pitch-yaw-1-4.png}).

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{2.1/11-pitch-yaw-1-3.png}
	\caption{Pitch \& yaw against time for participant 11 in scenario 1-3, showing RW/VR transitions.}

	\label{11-pitch-yaw-1-4.png}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Participant 7 showed this behaviour in a less extreme fashion, spending more time with each of the three user-controllable transition styles before settling upon transition 3, during scenario 1-4 (figure \ref{7-pitch-yaw-1-4.png}).

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{2.1/7-pitch-yaw-1-4.png}
	\caption{Pitch \& yaw against time for participant 7 in scenario 1-4, showing RW/VR transitions.}
	\label{7-pitch-yaw-1-4.png}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Some participants however continued to use all available transition styles throughout a session, such as participant 13 during scenario 1-3 (figure \ref{13-pitch-yaw-1-3.png}). This was one of the longest individual sessions, with the participant exploring the RW \& VR chapels in tandem in PR via the Mirrorshades platform for over 8.5 minutes. During the interview, s/he reported preferring transition 3 via the right trigger \texttt{[RT]} which is corroborated by the data - s/he triggered this transition more than transition 1 or 2 (25 times total, compared to 20 for transition 1 \& 14 for transition 2) \& spent longer perceiving VR via transition 3 (103 seconds total compared to 81.5 seconds for transition 1 \& 20 seconds for transition 2, with a mean of 4.12 seconds for each period using transition 3, 4.075 seconds for transition 1 \& 1.429 seconds for transition 2).

\end{figure}

%=====================

\subsubsection{Walking \& Head Movement}

As seen in the results to the stage 1 evaluation, there is also a correlation in the stage 2.1 results between position \& change in head movement, with several participants displaying greater changes in head pitch \& yaw while standing still than when walking with the DK1. This is true for both PR scenarios; figure \ref{8-1-3_2up.png} shows pitch \& yaw against time above, aligned with distance moved against time below, for participant 8 performing scenario 1-3, while figure \ref{9-1-4_2up.png} shows the same arrangement for participant 9 performing scenario 1-4. Especially after taking into consideration the slight lag in IPS data, the stationary periods starting around 120, 160, 200 \& 240 seconds in figure \ref{8-1-3_2up.png} \& those starting around 70, 150 \& 210 seconds in figure \ref{9-1-4_2up.png} all coincide fairly closely with pronounced changes in yaw.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

%=====================

\subsubsection{Use of Intermediary Opacities}

Confirming responses during the post task interviews, several participants did make use of the analogue selectable transition (transition 3, accessed via the right trigger \texttt{[RT]}) to view both RW \& VR environments together. Figures \ref{10-1-4_opacity.png} \& \ref{12-1-4_opacity.png} show, for participants 10 \& 12 undertaking scenario 1-4, the opacity of the objects upon which the camera feeds were rendered: an opacity of 1.0 means that the camera feed was completely opaque \& the participant was thus perceiving 100\% RW visual stimuli, while an opacity of 0 means that the camera feed was invisible \& the participant was perceiving 100\% VR visual stimuli. As well as using the analogue selectable transition to view both environments at once, there are incidents where it seems that the participant used the analogue selectable opacity not strictly to view both environments at once, but to control the speed at which a transition from RW to VR was performed. We can see that participant 10 (figure \ref{10-1-4_opacity.png}) uses transition 3 at around 250 seconds to perform a transition to a 100\% VR view, but at a slower rate than the linear interpolated transition such as can be seen just before at around 245 seconds. This greater level of control in how quickly transitions were performed was raised in interviews as a reason why this particular transition was favoured by some participants.

\subsection{IPQ}

IPQ results were scaled from the -3 to +3 range used by the questionnaires to the 0 to 6 range used to express results herein. The reversed items (SP2, INV3 \& REAL1) had their results appropriately reversed. Tables \ref{sp-2-1-table}, \ref{inv-2-1-table} \& \ref{real-2-1-table} show the mean \& standard deviation for SP, INV \& REAL respectively for the all of the scenarios (traditional scenario, scenario 1-3 \& sceiaron 1-4).

The traditional scenario produced baseline IPQ results for a traditional HMD based VR experience in which RW stimuli are suppressed from the user. SP \& INV results for this traditional scenario were relatively high, while the REAL results were low; this is not surprising, as the graphical quality of the VR chapel reconstruction used throughout the Mirrorshades evaluation was not stellar, partly as a result of having to intentionally reduce the level of detail in order to maintain acceptable framerates throughout the evaluations, thus it should come as no surprise that even though participants perceived bodily actions to be possible within the VR environment (high SP) \& found incompatible RW stimuli well suppressed (high INV) that the realness of the VR environment was nonetheless lacking (low REAL). As one participant said during their interview, it felt real even though it didn't look it - \textit{``\ldots obviously it wasn't the same quality, but I still felt so immersed in it. Even though part of me would've known it wasn't real, most of it felt real even though it didn't look like it''}.

In both PR scenarios SP \& REAL were reduced equally by a small amount, whilst INV was reduced more substantially \& with greater reduction for scenario 1-4 than for scenario 1-3. This meets the hypothesis that a positive PR experience would result in noticeably reduced INV but without substantial reduction in SP \& REAL. The reduced INV indicates that participants were more aware of RW stimuli, but the only marginally reduced SP indicates that their sense of presence in the VR environment did not drastically suffer \& the only marginally reduced REAL indicates that the perceived realness of the VR environment did not substantially suffer from tandem observation with the equivalent vantage points into the (necessarily real) RW environment, although the PR effect was evidently not positive enough to elicit heightened overall SP results as was hypothesized might happen.

Looking specifically at the results for SP3 \& INV2 (table \ref{sp3-inv2-2-1-table}), they seem to be tied together as per Constantin's observation (see section \ref{igroup-presence-questionnaire-explanation}) for the traditional scenario \& scenario 1-3 where they fall equally. However in scenario 1-4, INV2 drops substantially more than SP3 which climbs to above its level in scenario 1-3. This lends support to the notion that in a PR experience in which the user is encouraged (or forced, in the case of scenario 1-4 which featured transition 4) to view visual stimuli from two compatible environments that SP can be maintained, that the break in presence associated with a transition from one environment to the other is no so great as to effect a Gestalt switch \& throw off perceptual/concrete processing to an extent that sense of presence (in terms of focus of atttention) is drastically reduced.

\subsection{Summary}

Participants overwhelmingly preferred transition 3 compared to the others, which was somewhat surprising as initial experiments with the Mirrorshades platform with members of the OVW research group strongly indicated preference toward transition 2. With the larger number of participants in this stage of evaluation compared to the unscientific tests within the OVW group, this preference toward transition 3 should be considered legitimate even though unexpected. Reasoning for preference toward transition 3 included being able to see both environments at once \& a heightened sense of control.

Transition 4 was unanimously negatively received in terms of overall comfort \& enjoyment of the scenarios, however participants did comment on heightened awareness \& understanding between the two environments when transition 4 was present. Comments from participants concerning transition 4 such as that each time it occurred they would need to \textit{``stop \& work it out again''} directly supports the notion that transition 4 results in a larger break in presence, in terms of movement on the focus of attention axis from presence toward absence, than the the other transition styles, with `working it out' alluding to the notion of conceptual/abstract reasoning that sits opposite perceptual/concrete processing at the two ends of the balance of focus of attention.

One relationship that did not arise as expected was a preference toward different transition styles in different situations, such as using transition 1 when performing a quick check on the VR environment \& transition 3 when performing a more in-depth comparison. Instead it seems that most participants `experimented' with the transition styles available to them \& settled upon a favourite, then using that one style throughout the rest of the scenario. Either the difference in utility between the different transition styles was not great enough to prompt participants to consider using different styles in different situations, or comfort trumped utility \& participants continued to use the transition style they found most comfortable even if they thought that another might have served them better for a specific set of circumstances.

The same relationships with head movement as seen in stage 1 returned for stage 2.1, with substantially more variance in yaw than pitch across all scenarios, more variance in head movement when perceiving VR than RW during the PR scenarios \& more variance in head movement while standing stationary than when walking during the PR scenarios.

IPQ results met hypotheses, with the traditional scenario scoring highly in both SP \& INV while scoring lowly in REAL (explained by the low visual quality of the VR model) \& the PR scenarios only marginally reducing SP \& REAL while more substantially reducing INV. Of particular interest is that scenario 1-4 displayed a substantial gap between SP3 \& INV2, whereas with scenario 1-3 these values were reduced more evenly from their traditional scenario baseline. These IPQ results indicate that the PR scenarios undertaken by stage 2.1 participants succeed in allowing participants to experience the RW environment in tandem with the VR environment, without having a substantial negative effect upon their sense of presence in the VR environment or upon the perceived realism of the VR environment.

This stage of the evaluation has provided insight into some best practices for implementing future PR experiences. The ability to manually control the balance of RW/VR visuals has emerged as preferable to moree basic transitions that simply alternate between the extremes of 100\% RW \& 100\% VR, while adding uncontrolled VR visuals to the default view led to a negative effect upon enjoyment \& comfort but a positive effect upon observation \& understanding of the relationship between the two constituent environments.

\section{Stage 2.2}

One of the threads that emerged from the stage 2.1 investigation was that while transition 4 was unanimously negatively received because of the worse breaks in presence that it caused by `surprising' the participants, the VR visual stimuli that it presented without participants having to consciously trigger a transition led to several participants indicating that it resulted in them better understanding the relationship between the two environments \& noticing more differences between them. Stage 2.2 thus investigated how untriggered VR stimuli could be introduced into a PR experience but in a less obtrusive manner than transition 4, namely by changing the default view to less than 100\% RW.

Stage 2.2 followed the same pattern as stage 2.1, with participants first engaging in a traditional scenario in which they were seated \& used the DK1 \& Xbox controller to explore the VR chapel \& subsequently completed two PR scenarios in which they walked through the chapels, thus completing three scenarios in total;

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Traditional scenario} - Participants explore the VR chapel from a stationary position, as VR has traditionally been employed at cultural heritage sites via CAVE installations \& by the OVW group with Oculus HMDs, using the Xbox controller to move around the VR environment observed via the DK1, with the DK1 obscuring theier view of the RW chapel around them.
	\item \textbf{PR scenario with 75\% RW/25\% VR default view} - (Referred to as the `75/25 scenario') Participants experience the RW \& VR chapels in tandem using the Mirrorshades platform. They wear the DK1, holding the Xbox controller in their right hand \& the smartphone in their left, with the laptop \& control box bundle in a satchel worn over one shoulder. The default view on the DK1 screen is 75\% RW/25\% VR, achieved by setting the base opacity of the objects upon which the camera feeds are rendered to 75\%. The participants are furnished with a single transition style, the transition with linear interpolation (transition 2 from the stage 2.1 evaluation).
	\item \textbf{PR scenario with 50\% RW/50\% VR default view} - (Referred to as the `50/50 scenario') Participants undertake the same scenario as the 75/25 scenario, except the default view on the DK1 screen is 50\% RW/50\% VR, achieved by setting the base opacity of the objects upon which the camera feeds are rendered to 50\%. Participants are again fashioned with the linear interpolated transition as the only transition style.
\end{enumerate}

As the controlled variable between the two PR scenarios was opacity based, it seemed prudent not to fashion the participants with the ability to consciously affect opacity by giving them access to the analogue selectable opacity feature (transition 3 from the stage 2.1 evaluation). In the same manner as during stage 2.1, participants were simply instructed to make their way from the starting position down to the altar end of the chapel, with no hard restrictions upon their path or when/where they were to stop \& pay attention to particular aspects of their surroundings.

\section{Stage 2.2 Results}

A total of 4 participants completed the stage 2.2 evaluation;
\begin{itemize}
	\item Age ranged from 19 to 38, with a mean of 24.3 \& a standard deviation of 9.2
	\item 2x identified as male \& 2x as female
	\item 3x reported previous experience with a games console controller
	\item None reported previous experience with a HMD
	\item 1x reported having previously visited the chapel
	\item None reported having previously experienced the virtual chapel
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Likert-type Questionnaires}

	\caption{Likert-type questionnaire results for stage 2.2.}

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

When considering the responses to the Likert-type questionnaires (see figure \ref{9-item-likert-type-questionnaire.png}) for the two PR scenarios of the stage 2.2 evaluation, the following observations can be made.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Participants overall preferred the 75/25 scenario over the 50/50 scenario (q1)
	\item Participants found it easier to compare features from past \& present in the 50/50 scenario than the 75/25 scenario (q3)
	\item Participants experienced more motion sickness in the 75/25 scenario than in the 50/50 scenario (q5)
	\item The 50/50 scenario was reported as being less rewarding for exploring the chapel than the 75/25 scenario (q6)
	\item Participants thought that they did not notice differences between real \& virtual more in the 75/25 scenario than in the 50/50 scenario (q9)
\end{itemize}

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{Interview Transcripts}

Once again, the interview recordings that were transcribed after the chapel sessions gave valuable insight into the experience of the two PR scenarios in stage 2.2.

Two participants said that they preferred the 75/25 scenario, while the other two participants preferred the 50/50 scenario. Of those that preferred the 75/25 scenario, one explained that s/he felt more in control of whether s/he was seeing real or virtual while the other found the more obvious sudden VR movements visible during the 50/50 scenario to be uncomfortable. Of those that preferred the 50/50 scenario one reported that of the 75/25 scenario that it was \textit{``confusing to make sense of what I was seeing''} while the other found that switching to fully VR was less of a jump coming from 50/50, alluding to a less severe break in presence, thus was \textit{``more comfortable spending more time in the virtual''}.

All of the participants however reported that the 50/50 scenario was more engaging. Interestingly, one of the participants who reported preferring the 75/25 scenario largely because of inaccuracy of the IPS during the 50/50 scenario to cause disorientation, commented that this inaccuracy led to greater engagement because it would show him/her other parts of the VR chapel than were equivalent to his/her immediate surroundings. Two participants further reported that the 50/50 scenario made differences between RW \& VR more obvious, with one reporting not much discernible difference. One participant specially mentioned how the 50/50 scenario made it more \textit{``perceptible exactly where things were''} which led to seeing him/herself \textit{``walking through''} (virtual) things whereas with the 75/25 scenario s/he would have to \textit{``switch back \& forth \& then realise''}. One participant directly answered that they thought they used the button to manually transition more in the 50/50 scenario because it was less jarring than in the 75/25 scenario.

Mimicking responses from earlier stage interviews, one participant reported experiencing motion sickness during the traditional scenario when using the Xbox controller stick to turn, while when considering the PR scenarios three of the four participants reported less motion sickness during the 50/50 scenario.

\subsection{Log Data}

\subsubsection{Considering all scenarios (traditional \& PR)}

Once again, variance in yaw dominated during all three scenarios (traditional \& both PR scenarios) over variance in pitch, which is illustrated in figure \ref{14-pitch-yaw-trad-75-25-50-50.png} which shows pitch \& yaw against time for participant 14 for the traditional scenario at left, the 75/25 scenario in the middle \& the 50/50 scenario on the right (note that the 75/25 scenario is of substantially longer duration than the other two scenarios, thus the marked difference in initial appearance).

%=====================

\subsubsection{Comparing Between 75/25 \& 50/50 Scenario}

The main new observations that come to light when comparing log data for the two PR scenarios are that all of the participants performed fewer transitions in the 50/50 scenario than in the 75/25 scenario, with three of the participants also spending more time (both overall \& in terms of the average duration of the periods) perceiving the default position rather than VR in the 75/25 scenario than the 50/50 scenario. These values are summarised in tables \ref{times-75-25} \& \ref{times-50-50} for the 75/25 \& 50/50 scenarios respectively, while figures \ref{16-pitch-yaw-75-25.png} \& \ref{16-pitch-yaw-50-50.png} visualise this relationship for participant 16 performing the 75/25 scenario \& 50/50 scenario respectively.

\caption{Distribution of time spent in default \& VR environments for all participants during 50/50 scenario.}
\label{times-50-50}
\end{center}
\end{table}

In combination with interview feedback, these log data support the notion that the 50/50 scenario was more engaging, with participants not finding it necessary to perform transitions to VR as frequently in order to perceive enough VR stimuli to engage with the combined VR \& VR content.

When considering the distribution of variance in head pitch \& yaw in relation to whether participants were viewing the default position or VR, maximum variance in stage 2.2 was no longer as restricted to the VR periods. Participant 14 in particular frequently displayed maximum variance when viewing the default position, more so than when viewing VR, as shown by figure \ref{14-pitch-yaw-75_25.png}. While this is understandable in the sense that the participants no longer needed to perform a transition to VR in order to see the VR environment, it is worth highlighting that by allowing the user to see the VR environment in this manner means that they were simultaneously perceiving more angles of the RW environment which in earlier stages of evaluation they may not have seen as maximum variance in pitch \& yaw only occurred when they were viewing predominantly VR visual stimuli via the DK1.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

%=====================

\subsubsection{Walking \& Head Movement}

Concerning the relationship between variance in pitch \& yaw compared to whether participants were actively walking, most participants exhibited similar behaviour to previous stages of evaluation with maximum variance restricted to periods in which they were standing still.

However as can be seen in figure \ref{17-pitch-yaw-distance-moved-75-25.png} participant 17 exhibited extremely restricted head movement, only moving their head from looking straight ahead in the direction of moment upon reaching the altar end of the chapel \& turning around to return. Intuitively one might suppose that for a participant who did not feel sure of themselves when walking with the apparatus, not having a 100\% RW view would result in this static head behaviour as they focussed all of their attention on what lessened amount of the RW environment they could see in order to successfully navigate. However this participant did not report such lack of surety in the interview, although did mention performing fewer transitions in the 50/50 scenario as they were \textit{``trying to make sure I didn't bump into anything''} \& reviewing the video recording of this participant completing the 75/25 scenario showed them to walk comfortably \& deliberately. Thus the mostly static head activity is as likely to be attributable to simple disinterest with the environments or misunderstanding of the purpose of the scenarios.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

%=========================================================================================================

\subsection{IPQ}

When considering the IPQ results for stage 2.2 participants the traditional scenario presents very similar results for all of SP, INV \& REAL (tables \ref{sp-2-2-table}, \ref{inv-2-2-table} \& \ref{real-2-2-table} respectively) to the traditional scenario from stage 2.1 (tables \ref{sp-2-1-table}, \ref{inv-2-1-table} \& \ref{real-2-1-table}), which was to be expected \& reinforces these values as good baseline IPQ results for the traditional VR experience at the chapel.

SP was reduced in the 75/25 scenario, to a level slightly lower than that in both PR scenarios in stage 2.1, while in the 50/50 scenario that was a marked increase in SP to a level (4.7) above any other scenario in either stage, including the traditional scenarios. This hints toward the optimistic expectation of a good PR experience resulting in reduced INV but increased SP compared to a traditional scenario, but representation of bodily actions within the RW environment leading to an increase in experienced spatial presence within the VR environment.

INV was reduced in the 75/25 scenario \& further reduced in the 50/50 scenario, as was to be expected. Interestingly however, the INV results for both PR scenarios in stage 2.2 were notably higher than those for the PR scenarios of stage 2.1, a discrepancy that is not contained within the higher INV for the traditional scenario in stage 2.2 compared to stage 2.1.

REAL was reduced in the 75/25 scenario to almost exactly the same level as both PR scenarios in stage 2.1, however for the 50/50 scenario REAL was only reduced a miniscule amount (a reduction of 0.118 from 2.563 to 2.438). This implies that the increased visibility of the VR environment when perceiving the RW environment helped to enhance the perceived realness of the VR environment.

When considering SP3 \& INV2 in isolation, the mean SP3 for the traditional scenario is confusingly low at 1.75 (table \ref{sp3-inv2-2-2-table}). This is especially odd considering the relatively high mean for the overall SP subscale in the traditional scenario of 4.3 (table \ref{sp-2-2-table}. It is also completely out of line with the mean SP3 for the traditional scenario from stage 2.1 of 4.5 (table \ref{sp-2-1-table}), which was in keeping with the overall SP mean of 4.6 (table \ref{sp3-inv2-2-1-table}) for the traditional scenario in stage 2.1. This oddity could be explained by confusion among the stage 2.2 participants over the wording of SP3, which presents a negative - \textit{``I did \textbf{not} feel present in the virtual space''} (emphasis own), anchored between \textit{``did not feel''} \& \textit{``felt present''}.

\subsection{Summary}

This stage of the evaluation investigated the effects of changing the default view of a PR scenario to one that always includes some aspect of the VR environment, such that the user is at all times receiving some degree of VR stimuli even when they do not consciously trigger a transition into a non-default view \& without relying upon a severe break in presence causing instantaneous transition to \& from a 100\% VR view as was the case with transition 4 in the second of the stage 2.1 PR scenarios.

Comparing the PR scenarios from this stage of the evaluation to the second PR scenario from the stage 2.1 evaluation in which transition 4 was used, the IPQ results indicate that the 75/25 scenario reduced SP \& REAL to similar levels however the 50/50 scenario resulted in an almost imperceptible decrease in REAL \& a noticeable \textit{increase} in SP, while the results for the traditional scenario closely matched those from the stage 2.1 evaluation.

Despite these results \& the fact that the 50/50 scenario was reported as allowing easier comparison between the two environments, it was considered less rewarding \& was less preferred overall compared to the 75/25 scenario. In some ways this mimics the relationship between the first stage 2.1 PR scenario \& the second stage 2.1 PR scenario, where although the second led to furthered understanding of the two environments it did so at a cost of comfort \& enjoyability.

Fewer transitions overall during the 50/50 scenario with participants spending more time in total \& per transition viewing the VR environment in scenario 75/25 supports the notion that with an increased amount of VR visible in the default position that participants did not perceive the necessity to perform a conscious transition to see VR content that interested them. Considering the relationship observed in the stage 2.1 PR scenarios of maximum variance of head movement restricted to periods in which the participants were viewing 100\% VR, reducing the participants' reliance upon performing these transitions stands to benefit participants' observation of RW components that they would otherwise have missed by looking only at the VR environment when looking in certain directions.

However it is worth considering that while a default view that presents \textless 100\% RW does seem to increase participant exposure to angles of the RW environment other than those required to perceive when walking, by allowing users to look around at the VR environment when stationary without needing to perform a transition to 100\% VR \& thus losing all visual stimuli from the RW environment, that for a participant who feels less comfortable walking with the apparatus that not having a 100\% RW view available will likely have a detrimental effect to the experience as a whole. Furthermore, if a user wishes to inspect something in the RW environment in particular detail, not being able to activate a 100\% RW view may well reduce their ability to discern detail in this object, again hampering the overall PR experience. Although this stage 2.2 evaluation prevented users from occupying a position at the RW extreme of the locus of attention axis by always showing them at least 25\% or 50\% of the VR environment, this is not strictly a sensible approach. A sensible approach for real world application would perhaps be to allow toggling between a 100\% RW view \& one a (for example) 50/50 view, such that users could reap the benefits of the combined view but while maintaining the ability to transition back to a 100\% view \& the RW extreme of the focus of attention axis when the situation demanding it.

\section{Conclusions}

These evaluations have experimentally shown the value of the Mirrorshades platform (\& PR in general) as a new modality for on-site comparison of real \& virtual environments within the context of a cultural heritage site, as well as revealing a number of best practices for future implementations of PR systems.

The first stage of evaluation directly compared a traditional scenario in which VR has typically been used at cultural heritage sites with the new style of interaction afforded by the Mirrorshades platform, addressing both temporal \& spatial separation between experience of the real \& virtual environments. Despite the cumbersome nature of the system, participants found the PR experience to be both more enjoyable \& more rewarding than the traditional experience, allowing them to more easily perform comparisons between the constituent environments \& leading them to a better understanding of the site's history.

With the worth of the platform established by the stage 1 evaluation, the second stage of evaluation explored different implementation details of the platform to inform future implementation of similar systems such that the benefits of the concept can be best exploited. Stage 2.1 assessed participant responses to several different styles of performing transitions between the constituent RW \& VR environments, with a transition which furnished participants with complete control over the percentage of the visual stimuli of each environment that were presented to them emerging the clear favourite. The introduction of automatic transitions from RW to VR was met negatively when assessed in terms of enjoyment \& preference, but positively when assessed in terms of awareness \& understanding of the relationships between the two environments.

Stage 2.2 further investigated the concept of presentation of VR visual stimuli to the user without their conscious invocation of a transition, the intention being to raise awareness \& understanding between the environments without introducing the negativity of the automatic transition, by replacing the 100\% RW default view of earlier stages with ones that presented a percentage of each environment at all times. The more extreme case of a 50/50 split led to the greater increase in spatial presence within the VR environment \& a barely perceptible decrease in experienced realism of the RW environment, however the 75/25 split that led to a less remarkable change was preferred by the participants.
