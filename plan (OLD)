vacancy problem
- inability to immerse oneself in 3D synthetic environment(s) whilst maintaining awareness/ability to interact with grounded reality
- 'cross reality' proposed to address the problem

vacancy problem & polysocial reality
- simultaneous presence in grounded & synthetic environments opens up intriguing prospects for instantiations of PoSR involving 3D synthetic content (instead of just 2D social Web/apps)
- however previous cross reality research focused on 'fixed' points at which real & synthetic were linked (in a closed lab setting), thus not really allowing any investigation of the social aspects

Virtual Time Window (VTW)
- using an existing social-oriented multi-user synthetic environment platform (Second Life/OpenSimulator) & a hand-held tablet computer, controlled by physical position & orientation to reduce the cognitive load of maintaining presence in the synthetic environment, to ascertain the suitability of such techs to achieving mobile PoSR & how such achievements can benefit cultural heritage education situations

Mirrorshades
- using a mobile game dev platform (Unity) on common mobile hardware (Android) with either monocular HMD or full HMD with webcam window to grounded reality, using physical position & head orientation

Contrast the usefulness of a hand-held approach where one can 'put it down' & ignore it at any time, to the HMD approach where the view is always there, directly in your field of view
