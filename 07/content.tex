\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Content -} More in-depth explanation of contributions, identify future work (but don't dwindle).
	\item \textbf{What has been done -} Nothing.
	\item \textbf{What is left to do/how long should it take -} Should probably be written towards the end, after all design \& implementation, evaluation \& discussion has been completed. Should be a short section, 10 pages is probably far too long, shouldn't take long to write if the evaluation \& discussion section is done properly.
\end{itemize}
